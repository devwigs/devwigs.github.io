    <p class="Blue">Students perform an experiment where they use an electric heater to heat 100 grams of liquid water inside an insulated container.
        The water temeprature increases from 20.0° to 30.0° C as 4186 joules of heat is added. What is the specific heat capacity of water?</p>

    <p data-t="8">Intermolecular forces (such as hydrogen bonds) also represent a type of potential energy.</p>
    <ul data-t="9">
        <li>If you were to push an object 2.0 metres by applying a force of 10 newtons in the same direction that it is moving, you would be doing 20 joules of work.</li>
