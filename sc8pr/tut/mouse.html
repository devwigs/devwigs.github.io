<p>In addition to “click”, there are a number of other mouse events for which you can bind handlers...</p>

<ul>
<li><b>onmouseover</b>: Use this keyword to bind handlers to “mouseover” events, where the mouse pointer is moved onto a graphics object. This event is not triggered when an animated object moves under the stationary mouse; mouse motion is required to trigger the event. This event is triggered for graphics objects within the sketch but not on the sketch itself. You can still bind an <em>onmouseover</em> handler to the sketch to handle events where the <code>target</code> object does not have its own event handler.</li>
<li><b>onmouseout</b>: Use this to handle “mouseout” events, where the mouse pointer is moved off of a graphics object. When an animated object moves out from under the stationary mouse, the mouseout event will not be triggered until the mouse is moved. This event is not triggered on the sketch, but the sketch can handle events when the target does not have its own handler.</li>
<li><b>onmousemotion</b>: Use this to handle mouse motion within the sketch or any graphics object.</li>
<li><b>ondrag</b>: Use this to handle “drag” events, where the mouse is moved while holding a button down. If you want to allow the user to re-position an object by dragging it, you can import a generic <em>ondrag</em> handler...</li>
</ul>
