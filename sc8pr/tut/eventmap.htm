<p>As the previous page explained, your sketch monitors the Pygame event queue to keep track of the mouse and keyboard state. Your program can provide event handler functions that the sketch will call to respond to any events in the queue. Event handlers take two arguments: a reference to the sketch object and a description of the event.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we wanted to reset our animation by removing all sprites whenever the user typed the letter <code>"r"</code>. We could define the following event handler...</p>

<pre class="Code"><span class="Proto">def</span> keyDown(sk, ev):
    if sk.char == "r":
        sk.sprites.empty()</pre>

<p>To tell the sketch when to run the event handler, we pass a second argument, <code>eventMap</code>, to the <code>animate</code> method. The <code>eventMap</code> is a dictionary that has event codes as its keys and handlers as its values...</p>

<pre class="Code">from sc8pr.util import KEYDOWN

...

eventMap = {KEYDOWN: keyDown}
sk.animate(customDraw, eventMap)</pre>

<p>Here is the <a href="tut/example/keyDownExample.py">complete program</a>.</p>

<p>The event code constants defined in the <code>sc8pr.util</code> module have the same values as their Pygame equivalents...<p>
<ul>
	<li><code>KEYDOWN</code></li>
	<li><code>KEYUP</code></li>
	<li><code>MOUSEMOTION</code></li>
	<li><code>MOUSEDOWN</code> (shortened from Pygame's <code>MOUSEBUTTONDOWN</code>)</li>
	<li><code>MOUSEUP</code> (shortened from Pygame's <code>MOUSEBUTTONUP</code>)</li>
	<li><code>RESIZE</code> (shortened from Pygame's <code>VIDEORESIZE</code>)</li>
	<li><code>QUIT</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use the value <code>None</code> as a key in the <code>eventMap</code>, to specify a handler for events that do not match any of the keys that explicitly appear in the dictionary.</p>
