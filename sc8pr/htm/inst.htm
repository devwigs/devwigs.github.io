<article><h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Please ensure that you have <a href="https://www.python.org">Python 3.4 or higher</a> installed before proceeding.</p>

<p>Next, open your terminal program (e.g. Windows PowerShell). If you are installing <code>sc8pr</code> for all users you will likely need to run the terminal as an administrator. Make sure you have the latest versions of <code>pip</code> and <code>setuptools</code> by running the following command...
<pre class="Code">pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools</pre>
<p>On Windows, you may need to replace the command <code>pip3</code> at the beginning of the line by <code>py -3 -m pip</code>. If this still doesn’t work, locate the folder where Python is installed and use its <code>Scripts</code> folder as your current directory...</p>
<pre class="Code">cd "C:\Program Files\Python38\Scripts"
.\pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools</pre>

<p>Finally, install <code>sc8pr</code>. This should check if <code>pygame</code> is already installed and install it if it is not.</p>
<pre class="Code">pip3 install sc8pr==2.2a3</pre>

<!--p>If you have multiple versions of Python 3 installed, you can specify the version you want to use by changing <code>py -3</code> to <code>py -3.6</code> (Windows) or <code>pip3</code> to <code>pip3.6</code>, for example.</p-->
<p>If <code>pygame</code> is not already installed and <code>pip</code> cannot locate a build for your platform and Python version, you will need to install it manually before using <code>sc8pr</code>. Please visit the <a href="http://www.pygame.org"><code>pygame</code> website</a> if this happens.</p>
