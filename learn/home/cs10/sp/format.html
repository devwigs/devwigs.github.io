<h4 class="Collapse" data-collapse="templ"><em class="material-icons">expand_less</em>Templates &amp; Format Specifiers</h4>
<div id="templ">
<p>When writing a program, it is good to keep the user in mind. How will your program look to the
	people using it? Will they be able to understand how to use your program? As the programmer,
	you have a much greater knowledge of the program than your users.</p>

<p>One thing you can do to make your program more user-friendly is to make it visually appealing
	and organized. Python provides a function called <code>format</code> that gives you more control
	over how data is converted to text to be displayed in the console.</p>

<pre class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Save this program as 's15_ex1.py'</span>

from math import sqrt

num = float(input("What is your favourite number? "))
root = sqrt(num)
print("The square root of", num, "is", root, ".")</pre>

<p>The output of the program might look like this:</p>
<pre class="Code Black">What is your favourite number? <span class="Blue">6</span>
The square root of 6.0 is 2.449489742783178 .</pre>

<p>To make this output cleaner, we might want to round the answer to a smaller number of decimal places,
    and to remove the unnecessary space before the period. To do this, we create a <em class="Defn">template</em>
    string that shows what we want the output to like like, using curly brackets <code>{}</code> as
    placeholders to show where the data will be inserted. We can type an option <em class="Defn">format
    specifier</em> inside the brackets. In the example below, <code>.2f</code> is a format code that tells
    Python we want to insert data as a floating point number with two decimal places. Python requires a semi-colon
    immediately before the format specifier.</p>

<pre class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Save this program as 's15_ex2.py'</span>

from math import sqrt

num = float(input("What is your favourite number? "))
root = sqrt(num)
<span class="Blue">template = "The square root of {:.2f} is {:.2f}."</span>
print(<span class="Blue">template.format</span>(num, root))</pre>

<p>After creating your template, call its <code>format</code> function to insert the data into the
    template with the desired format. The example above produces the following output.</p>

<pre class="Code Black">What is your favourite number? 6
The square root of 6.00 is 2.45.</pre>
</div>

<h4 class="Collapse" data-collapse="table"><em class="material-icons">expand_more</em>Tables</h4>
<div class="Hidden" id="table">

<p>When a program displays data in a table, such as sports league standings, we want to make sure the
    columns line up properly. We can do this with a template and the <code>format</code> function as well.</p>

<pre class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Save this program as 's15_ex3.py'</span>

standings = [
    ("Pandas", 18, 2),
    ("Gryphons", 16, 4),
    ("Bears", 15, 5),
    ("Tigers", 11, 9),
    ("Lions", 7, 13),
    ("Sharks", 6, 14),
    ("Dinos", 3, 17)
]

<span class="Comment"># Print column headings</span>
<span class="Blue">template = "{:^10s} {:>5s} {:>5s}"</span>
print(<span class="Blue">template.format</span>("TEAM", "Won", "Lost"))

<span class="Comment"># Print the data</span>
<span class="Blue">template = "{:^10s} {:5d} {:5d}"</span>
for team, won, lost in standings:
    print(<span class="Blue">template.format</span>(team, won, lost))
</pre>

<p>This will produce the following output.</p>
<pre class="Code Black">   TEAM      Won  Lost
  Pandas      18     2
 Gryphons     16     4
  Bears       15     5
  Tigers      11     9
  Lions        7    13
  Sharks       6    14
  Dinos        3    17</pre>

<p>The format specifier <code>^10s</code> tells Python to display a string in a column ten
    characters wide. The caret (<code>^</code>) tells Python to centre the data within the column.
    We could change this to a less-than sign or greater-than sign to align along the left or right
    side of the column.</p>
<p>The format specifier <code>5d</code> tells Python to display an integer in decimal (not binary)
    format in a column that is five characters wide. We can specify a column width for floating point
    numbers too; <code>8.2f</code> means a floating point number with two decimal places in a column
    eight characters wide.</p>

<p>For more information on Python’s format function, see the <a target="Py3"
	href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?#str.format">documentation</a>.</p>

	<li><p>Complete the program <code>b05_circle.py</code> that prints a neatly-formatted table like

	<li><p>Suppose you want to take out a bank loan to help pay your university tuition. The repayment schedule for the loan
		can be printed as a table. Below is an example of a repayment schedule for a $2000 loan with an

	<pre class="CodeExample" data-file="test.txt" style="color:black">

   12   127.99     0.53   128.52     0.00</pre>
	<p>The interest each month is calculated by multiplying the amount owing by the interest rate,
		dividing by 12, and then rounding to the nearest cent (2000 * 0.0500 / 12 = 8.33). The balance
		at the end of the month is calculated by adding the interest amount to the amount owing and the
		subtracting the payment (2000 + 8.33 – 175 = 1833.33).  Note that the final payment amount is
		adjusted so that the final balance is exactly 0.</p>
	<p>Complete the program <code>b05_loan.py</code> that asks the user to input the loan amount,
		annual interest rate, and monthly repayment amount. The program should then use a
		<code>while</code> loop along with formatted output to produce a neatly formatted table
		like the one above. Note that the number of months it takes to repay the loan depends on the
		input provided by the user. Your program must figure out when the loan has been repaid; do
		not assume it will always be 12 months.</p>
