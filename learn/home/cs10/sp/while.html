<h4 class="Collapse" data-collapse="loop"><em class="material-icons">expand_less</em><code>while</code> Loops</h4>
<div id="loop">

<p>Often when we are writing a program to solve a problem, we need to run the same instructions
	repeatedly. Here is a program that keeps printing random numbers until it gets a number greater
	than 99.</p>

<pre class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's12_ex1.py'</span>

from random import uniform

num = uniform(0, 100)       <span class="Comment"># Get the first number</span>
<span class="Blue">while num <= 99:</span>            <span class="Comment"># LOOP...</span>
    print(num)              <span class="Comment">#   Print the number</span>
    num = uniform(0, 100)   <span class="Comment">#   Get a new number</span>
print(num)                  <span class="Comment"># Print the last number</span></pre>

<p>The <code>while</code> statement (shown above in blue) tells Python to repeat all of the indented
	instructions as long as a certain condition remains <code>True</code>.  The <code>while</code>
	statement and the indented block that immediately follows it is called a <em class="Defn">loop</em>.</p>

<p>In this example, the loop is controlled by a Boolean expression, <code>num &lt;= 99</code>. This
	“condition” will remain <code>True</code> as long as the <code>uniform</code> function returns a number
	that does not exceed 99. The program will keep printing random numbers until the <code>uniform</code>
	function eventually returns a number that is greater than 99. This makes the loop condition
	<code>False</code> and the loop will end. The program will print this last number and then exit.</p>

<p>In Python, <em class="Defn">indentation</em> is used to structure loops just as it is for <code>if-elif-else</code> blocks. Only the two indented statements in the example are repeated. The final statement in the program is unindented to show that it is not part of the loop. It will only run once, after the loop is finished.</p>
<p>Python allows you to have <em class="Defn">nested</em> indented blocks, for example an <code>if</code> statement inside a <code>while </code> loop:</p>

<pre class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's12_ex2.py'</span>

from random import randint

roll = None
while roll != 7:
    die1 = randint(1, 6)
    die2 = randint(1, 6)
    roll = die1 + die2
    if roll == 2:
        print("Snake eyes!")
    elif roll == 12:
        print("Boxcars!")
    else:
        print("You rolled a {}.".format(roll))</pre>

<!--p>In an earlier lesson, you used Python’s <code>turtle</code> module to draw a polygon. You used variables
	to let the user decide how big, what color, and how many sides the polygon had. We can now use a
	<code>while</code> loop to draw the correct number of sides.</p>

<pre class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Save this program as 's12_ex3.py'</span>

<span class="Comment"># This is only a portion of the program!!
# Run the complete program b02_polygon.py from the examples folder.</span>

while sides:
  forward(length)
  left(angle)
  sides -= 1</pre>

<p>The statements that we want to repeat (<code>forward</code> and <code>left</code>) have been indented.
	The <code>while</code> loop is controlled by the variable <code>sides</code>, which refers to the number
	of sides in our polygon. The final statement of the loop, <code>sides -= 1</code>, subtracts 1 from
	the value of <code>sides</code>. This has the effect of counting down the number of sides left to be
	drawn. When the countdown reaches zero, the loop ends.</p>

<p>The condition that controls the loop is supposed to be a <em>boolean</em> expression. In this example,
	we have used an <em>integer</em> instead. Python treats the number zero as <code>False</code>, and non-zero
	numbers as <code>True</code>. This applies to both floating point numbers and integers.</p-->

<h4 class="Collapse Blue" data-collapse="assign"><em class="material-icons">expand_more</em>Assignment</h4>
<ol class="Assign Hidden" id="assign">
<li>The program <code>s12_choice.py</code> presents the player with four choices and asks them to
    select one by typing a number between 1 and 4. If the user types a number outside of this range,
    the program needs to ask again, until it receives valid input. Modify the program so that it rejects
    any number that is not between 1 and 4 and asks the user to try again until valid data is received.
    (Do not worry about dealing with input that cannot be converted to an integer at all.)
<!--pre class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's12_choice.py'</span>

options = "Options:\n1. Attack\n2. Defend\n3. Run\n4. Quit\n"
choice = int(input(options))
print("You selected:", choice)</pre--></li>

<li>Write a Python program <code>s12_grade.py</code> to ask the user to enter their grade. Use
    a <code>while</code> loop so that if the user enters a number that is not between 10 and 12, the
    program will reject the grade and ask again.</li>

<!--li>In the <a href="../cse1110/algo.html" target="Algo">Algorithms</a> assignment from CSE 1110, you were given a flow chart that describes an
algorithm for factoring whole numbers. Implement the algorithm as a Python program <code>b02_factor.py</code>.</li-->

<!--li>Copy your Rock-Paper-Scissors program from the last assignment as <code>s12_rock.py</code>. Modify
    the program so that the user plays as Player 1 and the computer as Player 2. The player should be able
    to input <code>r</code>, <code>p</code>, or <code>s</code> from the keyboard for “Rock”, “Paper”, or
    “Scissors”, or <code>q</code> for “Quit”. The program should continue to loop until the user decides
    to quit.</li>

<li>Create a number guessing game, <code>b02_guess.py</code>, that randomly chooses an integer between
    1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number. The program should respond to each guess by print
    whether it is too high or too low, and should keep playing until the user guesses correctly. When the
    user finally guesses the number, the program should print how many guesses it took to find the number.</li-->
