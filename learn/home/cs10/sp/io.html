<p>Two of the key operations that programs can perform are input and output. <em class="Defn">Input</em>
	involves moving information into the computer’s memory from somewhere else, such as the keyboard or mouse;
	a file stored on a hard disk, DVD, or USB drive; or a network connection (e.g. WiFi, Bluetooth, or Ethernet).
	<em class="Defn">Output</em> involves sending information from the computer’s memory to another location,
	such as a monitor or printer, a file, or a network connection.</p>

<h4 class="Collapse" data-collapse="output"><em class="material-icons">expand_more</em>Console Output</h4>
<div class="Hidden" id="output">
<p>Python contains a <code>print</code> function that prints data to the <em class="Defn">console</em>, a text-only
	area of the screen. The <code>print</code> function is one of several <em>built-in</em> functions, which means
	that Python always loads it automatically. Unlike most functions, built-ins do not need to be imported.</p>

<p>Each <code>print</code> statement prints its data on a separate line. If the argument is an expression, Python
	<em class="Defn">evaluates</em> it before printing. In the example below, the second line will print <code>10</code>.</p>

<pre class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's06_ex1.py'</span>

print("Hello!")
print(5 * 2)</pre>

<p>You can print several pieces of data on a single line by passing multiple arguments to the same
	<code>print</code> call...</p>

<pre class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's06_ex2.py'</span>

print("Hello!", 5 * 2)</pre>

<p>Python adds a space character between the data being printed. If you want to specify a separator other than
	a space, you can specify the separator as the final argument...</p>

<pre class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's06_ex3.py'</span>

pi = 3.14
print("Hello!", pi, 5 * 2, <span class="Blue">sep=</span>" ;-) ")</pre>

<p>Note that you have to explicitly tell Python that you are using a custom separator using the keyword
	<code>sep</code>, as shown in blue in the example above. Otherwise, Python will just think that the last
	argument is a regular argument to be printed.</p>

<p>Also note that literal text like <code>"Hello!"</code> needs to be in quotes. You can use either double quotes
	as in the example, or single quotes like <code>'Hello!'</code>. Python assumes that <em>unquoted</em> text
	like <code>pi</code> or <code>print</code> is a variable or function name, or a reserved word like
	<code>import</code>.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="Collapse" data-collapse="input"><em class="material-icons">expand_more</em>Console Input</h4>
<div class="Hidden" id="input">

<p>Python has another built-in function called <code>input</code> that asks the user to enter some data. The
	data will be saved in the computer’s memory. Your program will need to assign a variable name to the data if
	it wants to use it later...</p>

<pre class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's06_ex4.py'</span>

user_name = input("Please tell me your name? ")
print("Hello, ", user_name, "!", sep="")</pre>

<p>Note again that <em>literal</em> text is quoted (<code>"Hello, "</code>) while variable names are not (<code>user_name</code>).</p>
</div>

<h4 class="Collapse" data-collapse="turtle"><em class="material-icons">expand_more</em>Turtle Graphics Input</h4>
<div class="Hidden" id="turtle">

<p>When running a turtle graphics program, you might want to ask the user to input some data to control how the
	turtle behaves. Rather than have to switch between the turtle graphics window and the console, you can use the
	function <code>textinput</code> (which has to be imported from <code>turtle</code>) instead of
	<code>input</code>...</p>

<pre class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's06_ex5.py'</span>

from turtle import textinput, setup, speed, penup, pendown, pencolor, left, forward, exitonclick

<span class="Comment"># Ask for color</span>
color = textinput("Color", "What color triangle do you want?")

<span class="Comment"># Assign canvas and triangle size</span>
canvas_size = 300
sides = 3
side_length = 2 / sides * canvas_size

<span class="Comment"># Set the canvas size and turtle speed</span>
setup(canvas_size, canvas_size)
speed(1)

<span class="Comment"># Move turtle into position</span>
penup()
left(90)
forward(side_length / 2)
left(150)

<span class="Comment"># Draw a triangle</span>
pencolor(color)
pendown()
for side in range(sides):
    forward(side_length)
    left(120)

<span class="Comment"># Finished!</span>
exitonclick()</pre>

<p>The <code>textinput</code> function uses a popup window to obtain input from the user. The function takes two
	arguments: a title for the popup window, and a message to prompt the user.</p>

<p>When asking for numerical input, use the <code>numinput</code> function instead of <code>textinput</code>.
	This will reject any user response that cannot be interpreted as a number.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="Collapse" data-collapse="ipo"><em class="material-icons">expand_more</em>IPO Structure</h4>
<div class="Hidden" id="ipo">
<p>Wherever possible, you should perform all input at the beginning of the program, then performing any calculations
	or other processing, and finally output the results. This is called the IPO (Input-Processing-Output) structure.<p>
</div>

<h4 class="Collapse Blue" data-collapse="assign"><em class="material-icons">expand_more</em>Assignment</h4>
<ol class="Assign Hidden" id="assign">
	<li>Copy your completed program <code>s05_polygon.py</code> as <code>s06_polygon.py</code>. Modify the program so that it asks the user for the size, number of sides, and color of the shape.</li>

	<li>Write a console program <code>s06_userInfo.py</code> to prompt the user to enter his or her name, age, and grade. Then print the information back to the user as in the example below. The black text is printed by the program and the blue text is entered by the user. Include a docstring and comments, and use the IPO program structure.
<pre class="Code" style="color:black">Please tell me your name: <span class="Blue">Chris</span>
Please tell me your age: <span class="Blue">15</span>
What grade are you in? <span class="Blue">10</span>

Your information...
Name: Chris
Age: 15
Grade: 10</pre></li>

<li>Save the program below as <code>s06_number.py</code>. The program does not behave the way its programmer intended! Read the program to figure out what it is <em>supposed</em> to do. Then run the program to see what it actually does. Describe what the program is supposed to do and actually does in the comments at the end of the file.</li>
<pre class="Code">num = input("What is your favourite number? ")
print(2 * num)
print(2 + num)</pre>
