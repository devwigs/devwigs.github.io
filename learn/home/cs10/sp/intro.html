<ol class="Assign" id="onedrive">
<li>Using the school computers, open Windows Explorer and go to your OneDrive folder.
    Create a folder named <code>CS10</code> and share the folder with your teacher (<code>david.maccarthy@eips.ca</code>).
    Click the “Allow Editing” button so your teacher can add files to your folder. Use this folder for all of your programming assignments.
    Copy the files from the <a href="https://eipsca-my.sharepoint.com/personal/david_maccarthy_eips_ca/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fdavid%5Fmaccarthy%5Feips%5Fca%2FDocuments%2Fpublic&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9laXBzY2EtbXkuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vOmY6L2cvcGVyc29uYWwvZGF2aWRfbWFjY2FydGh5X2VpcHNfY2EvRW1Yb1VGa3gxUnRHdk14dVdDZEJLZGtCUUpRLW5MUmVwcnRWZzN6VFdLS2l2QT9ydGltZT1ER1dZSGpwTTJFZw">public folder</a> into your own OneDrive folder.</li>
<li>Open Google Chrome and sign in using your EIPS account. Open <a target="Drive" href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> and
    create a folder named <code>CS10</code>. Again, share this folder with your teacher as an “Editor”.
    Use this folder for all assignments requiring a Google Doc.</li>
<li><b>HOMEWORK</b>: Install Microsoft OneDrive on your home computer (unless it’s already installed) and
    set it up to use with your EIPS account. Following the <a target="MS" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/office/sync-with-onedrive-bb89981b-e382-4969-b8fd-d413a90b6db3?ui=en-CA&rs=en-CA&ad=CA">instructions</a>
    for your system. Once successful, you should be able to see the <code>CS10</code> folder you
    created at school from your home computer.</li>

<div class="Hidden" id="prog">

<p>A computer is an electronic device that encodes and manipulates information as electronic signals.
	A <em class="Defn">program</em> is a set of instructions telling the computer what we want it to do.
	On modern computers, programs are stored in the computer’s memory as electronic signals called
	<em class="Defn">opcodes.</em> Programs written in this form are called <em class="Defn">machine
	language</em> programs. A machine language program appears as gibberish	to human readers, so it
	is not easy to write programs directly in machine language.</p>

<p>Computing scientists have invented many computer programming languages to make programming easier.
	Programming languages are often based on natural language and mathematics so that they are easier
	for humans to understand than machine language. Programming languages usually have strict
	<em class="Defn">syntax</em> (grammar and punctuation rules) that make them easier to translate
	into machine language.</p>

<p class="Center"><img class="Wide" alt="Image" src="img/lang.png"/></p>

<p>Programs that you write must be translated into machine language before the computer is able to
	run them. There are two types of translator programs. <em class="Defn">Compilers</em> translate
	the entire program and then save the resulting machine language program.
	<em class="Defn">Interpreters</em> translate the instructions one at a time and then run them as
	they are translated, without saving the program in machine language form. Some of the most popular
	languages (e.g. Java and Python) take an intermediate approach, using a compiler to save a partial
	translation and an interpreter to run the program. Partially-compiled programs are sometimes
	called <em class="Defn">bytecode</em>.</p>

<p>Computing scientists may use the terms <em class="Defn">high-level</em> or
	<em class="Defn">low-level</em> when describing a programming language. High-level programming
	languages are those that resemble natural language more than machine language. These have the
	advantage of being easier for programmers to use and make programming quicker. Python and Java
	are both high-level programming languages. Low-level languages are closer to machine language and
	have the advantage of running more efficiently.</p>
