    <h1>Science</h1>
    <p><em class="Defn">Science</em> is a body of knowledge about the natural world.</p>
    <p data-slide="1">Branches of Science include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-slide="1"><b>Physics</b>: The study of the fundamental laws of nature.</li>
        <li data-slide="2"><b>Chemistry</b>: The study of matter.</li>
        <li data-slide="3"><b>Biology</b>: The study of life.</li>
        <li data-slide="4"><b>Geology</b>: The study of the Earth.</li>
        <li data-slide="5"><b>Astronomy</b>: The study of stars, planets, and other objects in space.</li>

    <h1>Scientific Method</h1>
    <p>Science isn’t <em>just</em> knowledge. It also includes techniques for creating and testing knowledge.</p>
    <p data-slide="7"><em class="Defn">Experiments</em> are a key part of the <em class="Defn">Scientific Method</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-slide="8">If we understand how some aspect of nature works, we should be able to use that knowledge to make <em>predictions</em>.</li>
        <li data-slide="9">Experiments test whether our predictions are correct.</li>
        <li data-slide="10">Experiments help us find the limitations of our existing knowledge and give us the opportunity to develop better theories.</li>
    </ul>

<section data-slide="[11,15]">
    <h1>Experimental Variables</h1>
    <p><em class="Defn">Variables</em> are things that we <em>measure</em> when we perform an experiment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-slide="12">Most scientific experiments test a <em class="Defn">hypothesis</em> — a prediction about how changing one variable will affect another.</li>
        <li data-slide="13" class="Blue">“If we increase the <i>length</i> of a simple pendulum, the <i>time</i> it takes the pendulum to complete a swing will increase.”</li>
        <li data-slide="14">The variable that we are intentionally changing (<i>length</i>) is called the <em class="Defn">manipulated</em> (or <em>independent</em>) variable.</li>
        <li data-slide="15">The variable being affected (<i>time</i>) is called the <em class="Defn">responding</em> (or <em>dependent</em>) variable.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section data-slide="16">
    <h1>Controlled Variables</h1>
    <p>To test our hypothesis properly, the manipulated variable is the <em>only one</em> that can be allowed to change.</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-slide="17">If we change the mass and starting height of the pendulum as well as its length,
            we have no way of knowing which change caused the swing time to change.</li>
        <li data-slide="18">We must keep the mass and starting height <em>constant</em>.</li>
        <li data-slide="19">Variables that are deliberately kept constant are called <em class="Defn">controlled</em> variables.</li>
        <li data-slide="20">Failing to control variables properly makes the result of an experiment invalid.</li>
    </ul>
