    <li>A 0.300-kilogram apple hangs from a tree branch 2.75 m above the ground. Calculate the gravitational potential energy of the apple.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
$$E_g = mgh = \mathrm{(0.300\ kg) (9.81\ m/s^2) (2.75\ m) = 8.09\ J}$$

    <li>A 624-gram soccer ball is kicked down the field. At the highest point of the ball’s motion, it has a height of 3.76 m and a speed of 7.21 m/s. Calculate the mechanical energy (i.e. the total of the kinetic and gravitational potential energies) of the ball. Remember to convert grams to kilograms before performing any calculations.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2} (0.624\ kg) (7.21\ m/s)^2 = 16.2\ J}$$
$$E_g = mgh = \mathrm{(0.624\ kg) (9.81\ m/s^2) (3.76\ m) = 23.0\ J}$$
$$\mathrm{Mechanical\ Energy} = E_k + E_g = \mathrm{16.2\ J + 23.0\ J = 39.2\ J}$$

        <div class="Answer">$$\mathrm{80.0\ km/h = 80.0 \frac{10^3\ m}{3600\ s} = 22.2\ m/s}$$</div>

    <div class="Answer">
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$\frac{2E_k}{m} = v^2$$

        <li>A 68.0 kg cyclist is riding at 6.20 m/s along a path at the top of a 12.0-metre high hill. Calculate the cyclist’s mechanical energy.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2} (68.0\ kg) (6.20\ m/s)^2 = 1.31\times 10^3\ J}$$
$$E_g = mgh = \mathrm{(68.0\ kg) (9.81\ m/s^2) (12.0\ m) = 8.00\times 10^3\ J}$$

        <li>Assuming that the cyclist’s mechanical energy did not change (i.e. the gravitational potential energy lost was converted entirely into kinetic energy), what is the cyclist’s speed at the bottom of the hill?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
Since there is no gravitational potential energy, the mechanical energy is just the kinetic energy...
$$E_k = \mathrm{9.31\times 10^3\ J}$$
Re-arrange the kinetic energy equation...
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$\frac{2E_k}{m} = v^2$$
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}} = \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 9.31\times 10^3\ J}{68.0\ kg}} = 16.5\ m/s}$$

    <li>A 58.5-gram rock falls from a cliff face. The rock is initially 25.0 metres above the base of the cliff.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the mechanical energy of the rock before it falls.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
Since there is no kinetic energy, the mechanical energy is just the gravitational potential energy...
$$E_g = mgh = \mathrm{(0.0585\ kg) (9.81\ m/s^2) (25.0\ m) = 14.3\ J}$$
        </div>

        <li>Calculate the gravitational potential energy of the rock when it is 10.0 metres above the base of the cliff.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$E_g = mgh = \mathrm{(0.0585\ kg) (9.81\ m/s^2) (10.0\ m) = 5.74\ J}$$
        </div>

        <li>Assuming that the mechanical energy of the rock does not change, how much kinetic energy does it have when it is 10.0 metres above the base of the cliff?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$\mathrm{Mechanical\ Energy} = E_g + E_k$$
$$E_k = \mathrm{Mechanical\ Energy} - Eg = \mathrm{14.3\ J - 5.74\ J = 8.61\ J}$$
        </div>

        <li>Determine the speed of the rock at this point (i.e. 10.0 metres above the base of the cliff).</li>
        <div class="Answer">The algebra is the same as in #7c...
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}} = \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 8.61\ J}{0.0585\ kg}} = 17.2\ m/s}$$
