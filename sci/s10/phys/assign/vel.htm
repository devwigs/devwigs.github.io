<ol>
    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Define and give the formula for <b class="Red">velocity</b>.</li>
        <li>Explain the connection between the velocity equation and the slope equation. Why is this important?</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Explain how <b class="Red">speed</b> is different from velocity.</li>
    <li>What is the SI unit of velocity and speed? How do we convert to or from km/h?</li>
    <li>Explain how to solve motion problems where the velocity (or speed) is already known and you have to calculate either the time or displacement (or distance)?</li>
    <li>Define the following types of motion and explain how to determine from a graph what type of motion is occurring: (a) <b class="Red">uniform motion</b>, (b) <b class="Red">accelerated motion</b>.</li>
