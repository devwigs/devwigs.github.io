    <li>Science 10 students conduct an experiment by adding hydrochloric acid to 100 mL of distilled water. They added the acid 5 millilitres at a time and then measured the “pH” (a measure of acidity) after stirring the solution. Their data is shown in the table below.
    <table class="Auto TD">
        <tr><th>Acid Volume<br/>mL</th><th>pH of<br/>Solution</th></tr>
        <tr><td>0.0</td><td>7.0</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5.0</td><td>6.8</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10.0</td><td>6.6</td></tr>
        <tr><td>15.0</td><td>6.3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>20.0</td><td>6.0</td></tr>
        <tr><td>25.0</td><td>5.7</td></tr>
        <tr><td>30.0</td><td>5.5</td></tr>
        <tr><td>35.0</td><td>5.3</td></tr>

        <li>Which variable was manipulated?</li>

        <li>Which was the responding variable?</li>
        <div class="Answer">pH of Solution</div>

        <li>Identify at least two controlled variables.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Type of Acid, Amount of Water</div>

        <li>Draw a scatter plot of the data on graph paper.</li>
        <div class="Answer"><a target="D1" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vosm5izslt">Graph</a></div>

        <li>Is the graph “linear” or “non-linear”?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Linear</div>

        <li>Add a “best-fit line” to the graph. Use a ruler.</li>

        <li>How “scattered” are the data points? I.e. on average, how far are the data points from the best-fit line?</li>
        <div class="Answer">There is a small amount of scatter; the average distance of the points from the line is well under 0.1 on the pH axis.</div>

        <li>Using your best-fit line, predict the pH when 18.0 mL of acid is added to the water.</li>
        <div class="Answer">6.1</div>

        <li>Using your best-fit line, predict the pH when 40.0 mL of acid is added to the water.</li>
        <div class="Answer">5.0</div>

        <li>Record the endpoints of your best-fit line as visible on your graph. Use these two points to calculate the “rise” and “run”, and then the slope.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
Endpoints...
$$P_1 = \mathrm{(0.00\ mL, 7.04)}$$
$$P_2 = \mathrm{(35.0\ mL, 5.26)}$$
Rise and run...
$$\Delta(pH) = 5.26 - 7.04 = -1.78$$
$$\Delta V = \mathrm{35.0\ mL - 0.0\ mL = 35.0\ mL}$$
Slope...
$$\mathrm{Slope} = \frac{\Delta(pH)}{\Delta V} = \mathrm{\frac{-1.78}{35.0\ mL} = -0.051/mL}$$
