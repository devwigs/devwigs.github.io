        <li>What causes mechanical energy to be transformed?</li>
        <div class="Answer">When a force acts on an object, it may cause it to gain or lose kinetic energy. Energy gained must come from somewhere (chemical, electrical, gravitational) and energy lost must go somewhere (gravitational, sound, thermal)</div>

        <li>Define <b class="Red">force</b>. What are its SI units?</li>
        <div class="Answer">A force is a “push” or “pull” type of interaction between objects. It is measured in newtons.</div>

        <li>Define <b class="Red">work</b>. What are its SI units?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Work is the amount of mechanical energy that a force transformed. It is measured in joules (same as energy).</div>

<h3>Practice</h3>
<ol>

    <li>A 250-gram ball is kicked from the ground with an upward velocity of 12.5 m/s.<ol type="a">
        <li>Discuss all energy transformations as the ball moves first up and then back down to the ground. Identify the force that is responsible for each energy transformation.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The person who kicks the ball transforms chemical energy (food calories) into kinetic energy. The force of gravity then gradually converts the kinetic energy into gravitational potential energy as the ball rises, and then back to kinetic energy as the ball falls. Air resistance converts some of the kinetic energy into sound or thermal energy.  The force of the ground pushing on the ball transforms kinetic energy into sound and thermal energy.</div>

        <li>Calculate the mechanical energy of the ball.</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2}(0.250\ kg) (12.5\ m/s)^2 = 19.5\ J}$$</div>

        <li>The ball’s velocity will be zero at the highest point in its motion (i.e. before the velocity becomes negative when the ball begins to fall). Assuming that the mechanical energy is conserved, calculate the maximum height that the ball reaches.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$E_g = mgh$$
$$h = \frac{E_g}{mg} = \mathrm{\frac{19.5\ J}{0.250\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2} = 7.96\ m}$$
        </div>

        <li>In reality, the maximum height of the ball will be slightly less than calculated. Explain why this happens.</li>
        <div class="Answer">This happens because the air resistance force transforms some of the mechanical energy into thermal energy.  At its highest point, the ball has less mechanical energy than it started with.</div>

        <li>Calculate the height of the ball when its speed is 5.00 m/s. Again, assume mechanical energy is conserved.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2}(0.250\ kg) (5.00\ m/s)^2 = 3.13\ J}$$
Since total energy is conserved, the gravitational potential energy must be...
$$E_g = \mathrm{19.5\ J - 3.13\ J = 16.4\ J}$$
$$h = \frac{E_g}{mg} = \mathrm{\frac{16.4\ J}{0.250\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2} = 6.69\ m}$$
        </div>

    </ol></li>

    <li>A 50.0 kg skier starts from rest (point A) at the top of a 34.0-metre high ski hill.
    <p class="Center"><img alt="Hill" width="384" src="s10/phys/assign/img/hill.png"/></p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the speed of the skier (assuming no change in mechanical energy) at the bottom of the hill (point D, \(h\) = 0.0 m).</li>
        <div class="Answer">At the top of the hill, there is only gravitational potential energy...
$$E = mgh_i = \mathrm{50.0\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 34.0\ m = 1.67\times 10^4\ J}$$
At the bottom of the hill, all of this energy has been transformed into kinetic energy...
$$E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$2E_k=mv^2$$
$$\frac{2E_k}{m}=v^2$$
$$\begin{align}
v &= \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}}
\\ &= \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 1.67\times 10^4\ J}{50.0\ kg}}}
\\ &= \mathrm{25.8\ m/s}
\end{align}$$</div>

        <li>Repeat the calculation for a skier of mass 60.0 kg. Does the mass affect the answer?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$E = mgh_i = \mathrm{60.0\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 34.0\ m = 2.00\times 10^4\ J}$$
$$\begin{align}
v &= \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}}
\\ &= \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 2.00\times 10^4\ J}{60.0\ kg}}}
\\ &= \mathrm{25.8\ m/s}
\end{align}$$
There is no difference in the final speed!</div>

        <li>Calculate the speed of the skier (assuming no change in mechanical energy) at point C (\(h\) = 10.0 m).</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$E_g = mgh = \mathrm{50.0\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 10.0\ m = 4.91\times 10^3\ J}$$
Since total energy is conserved, the kinetic energy at this point is...
$$E_k = \mathrm{1.67\times 10^4\ J - 4.91\times 10^3\ J = 1.18\times 10^4\ J}$$
$$\begin{align}
v &= \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}}
\\ &= \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 1.18\times 10^4\ J}{50.0\ kg}}}
\\ &= \mathrm{21.7\ m/s}
\end{align}$$</div>

        <li>How much work did the force of gravity do on the skier between point A and C?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Work is the amount of kinetic energy gained...
    $$W = \Delta E_k = \mathrm{1.18\times 10^4\ J - 0.00\ J = 1.18\times 10^4\ J}$$</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">A student drops a 0.600 kg basketball from an initial height of 2.00 metres.
        <li>Calculate the speed at which the ball will strike the ground if we neglect the effects of air resistance.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Initially, the ball has only gravitational potential energy...
$$E_g = mgh = \mathrm{0.600\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 2.00\ m = 11.8\ J}$$
When the ball reaches the ground, all of this energy has been transformed into kinetic energy...
$$\begin{align}
v &= \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}}
\\ &= \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 11.8\ J}{0.600\ kg}}}
\\ &= \mathrm{6.26\ m/s}
\end{align}$$</div>
    
        <li>Would the answer change if the mass of the basketball was different?</li>
        <div class="Answer">No, because the numerator and denominator would both change by the same amount. We can see this by writing the formulas for the equal energies...
$$mgh_i = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$$
We can see that the \(m\) will cancel because it appears on both sides!
</div>
    
        <li>Suppose the air resistance acting on the falling ball caused it to lose 1.50 joules of energy. What would its speed be when it reached the ground?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
Subtract 1.50 J from the kinetic energy:
$$E_k = \mathrm{11.8\ J - 1.50\ J = 10.3\ J}$$
$$\begin{align}
v &= \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}}
\\ &= \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 10.3\ J}{0.600\ kg}}}
\\ &= \mathrm{5.85\ m/s}
\end{align}$$
Note that if we changed the mass, the answer would be different now because the mass does not cancel...
$$mgh_i - \mathrm{1.50\ J} = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$$
        </div>

    <li>A child launches a Hot Wheels car with a speed of 4.00 m/s at ground level. Calculate the speed of the car when it reaches the top of a hill that is 52.0 cm high. Neglect the effects of air resistance.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
Oh no! They didn’t give us the mass! The car starts with kinetic energy...
$$E = \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2$$
When it goes up the hill, some of that energy becomes gravitational potential energy and the rest remains as kinetic energy...
$$E = mgh_f + \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$$
Since the total energy does not change...
$$\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 = mgh_f + \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$$
The mass cancels...
$$\frac{1}{2}v_i^2 = gh_f + \frac{1}{2}v_f^2$$
$$v_i^2 = 2gh_f + v_f^2$$
$$v_i^2 - 2gh_f = v_f^2$$
$$\begin{align}
v_f &= \sqrt{v_i^2 - 2gh_f}
\\ &= \mathrm{\sqrt{(4.00\ m/s)^2 - 2(9.81\ m/s^2)(0.520\ m)}}
\\ &= \mathrm{2.41\ m/s}
\end{align}$$
Alternatively, you could just make up any mass you want since the answer will be the same no matter what the mass is!</div>
