<h3>Review</h3>
<ol>
    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Define and give the formula for <b class="Red">acceleration</b>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Acceleration is the rate at which the velocity changes:
$$\vec{\mathbf{a}}=\frac{\Delta\vec{\mathbf{v}}}{\Delta t}$$</div>

        <li>What does acceleration mean? For example, if a car has an acceleration of +2.0 m/s<sup>2</sup>, what does this tell you about its motion?</li>
        <div class="Answer">It means that the car’s velocity changes by +2.0 m/s each second. If a car is moving at +20.0 m/s, its velocity would be +22.0 m/s one second later, and then +24.0 m/s after another second, and so on.</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li>Explain the connection between the acceleration equation and the slope equation. Why is this important?</li>
    <div class="Answer">If we have a graph of velocity versus time, \(\Delta\vec{\mathbf v}\) will be the “rise” and \(\Delta t\) will be the “run”, so \(\vec{\mathbf a}\) will be the slope. This means we can tell whether the motion is accelerated, whether the acceleration is constant or not, and whether it is positive or negative just be looking at the graph.</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>What will an object’s acceleration be on Earth, when it is rising or falling and there are no forces acting on it except for gravity?</li>
        <div class="Answer">–9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>. This situation almost never occurs, due to air resistance. We would need to conduct an experiment in a chamber where all the air had been pumped out to measure this value.</div>

        <li>Will the acceleration be the same on Mars? In a spacecraft orbiting high above Earth? Explain.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Gravity is weaker on Mars than Earth because Mars is smaller. Gravity also gets weaker as we get farther away from a planet, so in both of these case the acceleration would be less than 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</div>

        <li>What effect does the atmosphere have on moving objects?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The presence of air, water, or any other fluid means that the moving object needs to push the fluid out of its way as it moves. This creates a force that acts to slow the object’s motion. Because of this effect, the actual acceleration of an object moving under the influence of Earth’s gravity will not be <em>exactly</em> 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</div>

        <li>Which part of the graph (between which two times) is the car undergoing uniform motion? Which part of the graph illustrates accelerated motion? Explain.</li>
        <div class="Answer">It is uniform for the first 2.0 seconds (velocity is constant 60 km/h) and then accelerated for the next 4 seconds.</div>

        <li>Calculate the acceleration for the portion of the motion over which the car is slowing. (In other words, calculate the slope of the line segment representing accelerated motion.)</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$\begin{align}
\vec{\mathbf a} &= \frac{\Delta\vec{\mathbf v}}{\Delta t}
\\ &= \mathrm{\frac{(0.00 - 16.7)\ m/s}{(6.0 - 2.0)\ s}}
\\ &= \mathrm{-4.2\ m/s^2}
\end{align}$$</div>

        <li>Calculate the average acceleration for the entire 6.0 seconds of the data. (In other words, what would be the slope of an imaginary line segment connecting the first and last data points?)</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$\begin{align}
\vec{\mathbf a} &= \frac{\Delta\vec{\mathbf v}}{\Delta t}
\\ &= \mathrm{\frac{(0.00 - 16.7)\ m/s}{(6.0 - 0.0)\ s}}
\\ &= \mathrm{-2.8\ m/s^2}
\end{align}$$</div>

    <li>A cyclist is coasting at 5.00 m/s. The cyclist begins to accelerate as they go down a hill, reaching a velocity of 8.50 m/s in 2.50 seconds. Calculate the cyclist’s acceleration.</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$\begin{align}
\vec{\mathbf a} &= \frac{\Delta\vec{\mathbf v}}{\Delta t}
\\ &= \mathrm{\frac{(8.50 - 5.00)\ m/s}{2.50\ s}}
\\ &= \mathrm{+1.40\ m/s^2}
\end{align}$$</div>

    <li>If an object is accelerating does its velocity have to be changing? Does its speed have to be changing? Explain.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, the velocity has to be changing for an object to be accelerating.
        In other words, if \(\Delta\vec{\mathbf v}\) = 0 then \(\vec{\mathbf a}\) will always be 0. The speed does not have to change.
        For example, if the velocity changes from +5 m/s to –5 m/s, \(\Delta\vec{\mathbf v}\) = –10 m/s so the acceleration is not zero even though the speed is unchanged.</div>
