<h3>Review</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Discuss the contributions of Count Rumford, Julius Meyer, and James Joule to our understanding of <b class="Red">heat</b>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Rumford: Disproved “caloric” theory by showing that heat could be generated by friction.</p>
        <p>Meyer: Demonstrated that the body needs less energy in warm climates (more oxygen in blood).</p>
        <p>Joule: Demonstrated that heat could be generated from mechanical energy.</p>
    </div>

    <li>Describe the <b class="Red">phlogiston</b> and <b class="Red">caloric</b> theories of heat and explain why those theories were discarded.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Both proposed that heat was an invisible fluid. These theories could not explain why some materials gain mass when they burn or how friction between two cold objects could produce heat.</div>

    <li>Explain how the theory of atoms and molecules can be used to understand the difference between solids, liquids, and gases. Include illustrations.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Solids have fixed shapes; the particles do not have enough energy to move past their neighbours.</p>
        <p>Liquids have a fixed volume but take the shape of their container; they are still bounds to their neighbours but have enough energy to move around.</p>
        <p>Gases expand to fill their container; particles have sufficient energy to escape the forces trying to bind them to their neighbours.</p>
    </div>

    <li>Explain how <b class="Red">kinetic molecular theory</b>explains the concept of temperature.</li>
    <div class="Answer">The molecules of a substance are constantly in motion. Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of these particles.</div>

    <li>Explain the difference between <b class="Red">thermal energy</b>, <b class="Red">heat</b> and <b class="Red">temperature</b>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of the molecules, not just the average. Heat means a transfer of thermal energy from one place to another.</div>

    <li>State the <b class="Red">First</b> and <b class="Red">Second Laws of Thermodynamics</b>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>1st: Energy is conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed.</p>
        <p>2nd: It is not possible to extract all of the thermal energy and convert it to useful energy; energy transformations tend to be less than 100% efficient.</p>
    </div>

    <li>Explain how kinetic molecular theory predicts that gases will exert <b class="Red">pressure</b> trying to expand their container, and why hotter gases exert more pressure.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Whenever a molecule collides with its container, it exerts a small amount of outward force. The combined force of all the gas molecules creates the pressure that causes the gas to expand. At higher temperatures, molecules are moving faster so they produce more force when they collide.</div>
