<ol>
    <li>A baseball is moving with 24.0 joules of kinetic energy. The batter hits the ball, after which the baseball’s kinetic energy is 82.0 J.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>How much work did the batter do on the baseball?</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$W = \Delta E_k = E_{kf} - E_{ki} = \mathrm{82.0\ J - 24.0\ J = 58.0\ J}$$</div>

        <li>What was the average force of the bat acting on the ball, if the bat and ball were in contact with each other through a displacement of 1.40 metres?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$W = \vec{\mathbf F}_{avg} \cdot \Delta\vec{\mathbf d}$$
$$\vec{\mathbf F}_{avg}
= \frac{W}{\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}}
= \mathrm{\frac{58.0\ J}{1.40\ m}
= 41.4\ N}$$</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>A hockey player exerts an average force of 9.40 newtons on the puck. The puck moves through a displacement of 40.0 cm while in contact with the hockey stick. How much work did the player do on the puck?</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$W = \vec{\mathbf F} \cdot \Delta\vec{\mathbf d}
= \mathrm{9.40\ N \cdot 0.400\ m = 3.76\ J}$$</div>

        <li>If the puck was moving with a kinetic energy of 3.50 J before the hockey stick made contact, what was the puck’s kinetic energy after being shot?</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$W = \Delta E_k = E_{kf} - E_{ki}$$
$$E_{kf} = E_{ki} + W = \mathrm{3.50\ J + 3.76\ J = 7.26\ J}$$</div>

    <li>As a block slides 85.0 cm down a ramp, friction causes the block to lose 75.0 J of mechanical energy. Calculate the force of friction.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
$$W = \vec{\mathbf F} \cdot \Delta\vec{\mathbf d}$$
$$\vec{\mathbf F}
= \frac{W}{\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}}
= \mathrm{\frac{-75.0\ J}{0.850\ m}
= -88.2\ N}$$

        <p>The graph below shows the force exerted by one bumper car on another during a collision.</p>
        <p class="Center"><img alt="Graph" src="phys/assign/img/bumper.png"/></p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the work experienced by the car.</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$W = \mathrm{Area
= \frac{1}{2} \times Base \times Height
= \frac{1}{2} (0.40\ m) (360\ N)
= 72\ J}$$</div>

        <li>If the bumper car was moving with 300 J of kinetic energy before the collision, how much kinetic energy would it have after the collision?</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$W = \Delta E_k = E_{kf} - E_{ki}$$
$$E_{kf} = E_{ki} + W = \mathrm{300\ J + 72\ J = 372\ J}$$</div>

    <li>A 65.0 kg cyclist is riding at a speed of 4.20 m/s. The cyclist pedals harder, causing her speed to increase to 6.35 m/s.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the cyclist’s initial kinetic energy.</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$E_{ki} = \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2

        <li>Calculate the cyclist’s final kinetic energy.</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$E_{kf} = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2

        <li>How much work did the cyclist do while accelerating?</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$W = \Delta E_k  = E_{kf} - E_{ki}

        <li>Estimate the average force that the cyclist exerted if the pedals moved 4.25 metres while she was accelerating.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
$$W = \vec{\mathbf F} \cdot \Delta\vec{\mathbf d}$$
$$\vec{\mathbf F}

    <li>A 32.5 kg child climbs into his toboggan at the top of a hill that is 5.60 m high and 25.3 m long. Gravity causes the child to begin sliding down the hill. The speed of the child and toboggan at the bottom of the hill is 7.20 m/s.

        <div class="Answer">$$E_i = mgh_i

        <div class="Answer">
$$W = \Delta E = \mathrm{842\ J - 1785\ J = -943\ J}$$
