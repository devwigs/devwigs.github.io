<h3>Review</h3>
<ol>
    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>What is a scatter plot and when do we use it?</li>
        <div class="Answer">A graph that shows how the manipulated and responding variables are related when both are numerical measurements.</div>
    
        <li>Why must scatter plots be drawn and graph paper, and why is it best to use as much of the available space as possible?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Graph paper helps make the graph more precise. Larger graphs can be read more precisely too.</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Which variable goes on which axis for a scatter plot?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Manipulated variable goes on the horizontal (bottom) axis and responding goes on the vertical (side).</div>

        <li>Summarize the key features in properly labelling each axis.</li>
        <div class="Answer"><ul>
            <li>Include the name, symbol, and units for the variable.</li>
            <li>Number the squares at a fixed interval (e.g. every second square).</li>
            <li>Numbering of squares must increase by a fixed amount (e.g. 0, 5, 10, 15, 20...)</li>
            <li>If you do not start numbering at 0, start at a number that is a multiple of what you are counting by.</li>
        </ul></div>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>State two reasons for adding a best-fit line to a scatter plot?</li>
        <div class="Answer">To illustrate the trend of the data, make predications about the data, and see how scattered the data is.</div>

        <li>When would you not want to add a best-fit line?	</li>
        <div class="Answer">When the data has an obvious curve.</div>

        <li>Describe how to draw an appropriate best-fit line.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Place your ruler on the <em>mean</em> (average) of both variables and rotate the ruler so that the average distance to the data points is as small as possible.</div>

        <li>Define interpolation and extrapolation.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Interpolation means using the best-fit line to make predictions within the range of data. Extrapolation is when we make predictions that go beyond the range of the data.</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Summarize how to calculate the slope of a best-fit line.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Identify two points from opposite ends of the best-fit line, and record the coordinates of both lines. Calculate the rise (difference in \(y\)-values) and run (difference in \(x\)-values) and divide to get the slope:
            $$k = \mathrm{\frac{Rise}{Run}} = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$</div>

        <li>How do you determine the units of the slope?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The units of the \(y\)-axis divided by the units of the(x\)-axis.</div>
        
        <li>What is the significance of the slope? In other words, what does the slope tell us about the data?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Slope tells the ratio of how the variables change; how much the responding variable changes for each unit change in the manipulated variable.</div>
    </ol></li>

<h3>Practice</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>Students took measurements of the height and circumference of several trees of the same species, growing in the same area. They collected the following data.</p>
    <table class="Auto TD TD6">
        <tr><th>\(C\) / m</th><th>\(h\) / m</th></tr>
        <tr><td>6.17</td><td>19.2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5.72</td><td>17.7</td></tr>
        <tr><td>1.93</td><td>9.2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4.50</td><td>15.2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.90</td><td>8.0</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3.41</td><td>14.7</td></tr>
        <tr><td>1.36</td><td>4.25</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8.50</td><td>14.4</td></tr>
    </table>  
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Based on how the data is presented, which variable is being treated as the manipulated variable and which is being treated as the responding variable?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The manipulated variable is the first column, <i>Circumference</i>. The responding variable is the second column, <i>Height</i>.</div>
    
        <li>Why is it important that the data is collected only from trees of the same species and only from trees growing in the same area?</li>
        <div class="Answer">These are <em>controlled variables</em>. If the variables are not properly controlled, we cannot make any conclusions or predictions from our data!</div>
    </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Draw a scatter plot of the data on graph paper. Add a best-fit line.</li>
    <div class="Answer"><iframe class="Center" src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/4h8xenqpr9?embed" width="720" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe></div>
    
    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Identify the visible endpoints of your best-fit line.</li>
        <div class="Answer">(0.0 m, 6.8 m) and (12.0 m, 24.8 m). Answers may vary!</div>
        
        <li>Calculate the slope of your best-fit line. Show all work.</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$k = \frac{h_2 - h_1}{C_2 - C_1} = \mathrm{\frac{(24.8 - 6.8)\ m}{(12.0 - 0.0)\ m} = 1.5}$$</div>

        <li>Using your best-fit line, predict the height of a “typical” tree of this species in this location that has a circumference of 2.00 metres. Explain how you made your prediction.</li>
        <div class="Answer">About 9.6 metres. Find 2.0 metres of the <i>Circumference</i> axis and read the <i>Height</i> from the graph where the best-fit line passes.</div>

        <li>Using your best-fit line, predict the circumference of a “typical” tree of this species in this location that has a height of 20.0 metres. Explain how you made your prediction.</li>
        <div class="Answer">About 8.8 metres. Find 20.0 metres of the <i>Height</i> axis and read the <i>Circumference</i> from the graph where the best-fit line passes.</div>

        <li>For (c) and (d), which prediction would you be more confident of? Why?</li>
        <div class="Answer">For (c) we are interpolating, which is more reliable than extrapolating as in (d).</div>
