        <li>Define <b class="Red">phase change</b>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">A phase change is when a material changes from solid to liquid, liquid to gas, or solid to gas when heat is added; or when heat is removed and the change occurs in the reverse direction.</div>

        <li>Explain why the temperature of a substance does not change even though heat is being added during a phase change.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Temperature is a measure of kinetic energy. During a phase change, the heat added increases the potential energy associated with the intermolecular forces.</div>

<h3>Practice</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Recall from chemistry that the molar mass of a substance can be calculated from the periodic table. We can convert between mass (\(m\), in grams) and moles (\(n\)) using the equation $$n = \frac{m}{M}$$ where \(M\) is the molar mass.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the molar mass of water.</li>
        <div class="Answer">2 × 1.01 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol = 18.02 g/mol</div>

        <li>How many moles are present in 250 grams of water?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$n = \frac{m}{M} = \mathrm{\frac{250\ g}{18.02\ g/mol} = 13.9\ mol}$$
