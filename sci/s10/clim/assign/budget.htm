<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
<ul><li>What causes the seasons? Why is it summer in the southern hemisphere when it is winter in the northern hemisphere?</li></ul>

<h3>Review</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Define <b class="Red">open</b>, <b class="Red">closed</b> and <b class="Red">isolated</b> systems. Which type of system is Earth?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Open = Matter and energy can both leave or enter the system.</p>
        <p>Closed = Energy (but not matter) can leave or enter the system.</p>
        <p>Isolated = Neither energy nor mattercan leave or enter the system.</p>
        <p>Earth is <em>nearly</em> a closed system; a very small amount of matter enters or leaves.</p>

    <li>What does <b class="Red">biosphere</b> mean? What are the three parts of Earth’s biosphere?</li>
    <div class="Answer">Biosphere is the part of Earth where life is found: Atmosphere (air), Hydrosphere (water) and Lithosphere (land).</div>

    <li>Why and how is the incoming radiation that Earth receives from the Sun different from the outgoing radiation that Earth sends into space?</li>
    <div class="Answer">The Sun is about 20 times hotter than the Earth, so it emits mostly visible, ultraviolet, and some infrared radiation. Earth emits almost entirely IR.</div>

    <li>What do we mean by Earth’s <b class="Red">radiation budget</b>? According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, what must happen if the incoming and outgoing radiation do not balance?</li>
    <div class="Answer">This refers to the balance among incoming, reflected, absorbed, and emitted radiation by Earth. According to the Laws of THermodynamics, if there is a difference between the total incoming and outgoing energy, the average temerature of the climate system must change.</div>

    <li>Define and explain what <b class="Red">albedo</b> means.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Albedo is the percentage of the incoming radiation from the Sun that is reflected without being absorbed.</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Describe the <b class="Red">greenhouse effect</b>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Incoming radiation in the Sun is primarily visible light which passes through the atmosphere easily.
            Outgoing radiation from Earth is infrared, much of which is absorbed by CO<sub>2</sub> and other gases in the atmosphere.
            Since these greenhouse gases affect outgoing but not incoming radiation, they alter the energy budget balance.
    </div>

        <li>How would Earth’s climate be different if there were no greenhouse gases in the atmosphere?</li>
        <div class="Answer">It would be much colder as more infrared radiation would carry energy away from the Earth.</div>
