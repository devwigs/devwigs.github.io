<ul><li>You will need to read pages 386-394 of <i>ScienceFocus 10</i> to be able to answer some of these questions.</li></ul>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Explain what <b class="Red">conduction</b> is and give examples of heat transfer by conduction.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Conduction is the transfer of heat by contact between materials. When the molecules of the hotter object collide with molecules of the colder object, there is a net transfer of thermal energy.</div>
    
        <li>Explain how <b class="Red">convection</b> works.</li>
        <div class="Answer">When a fluid (liquid or gas) is heated, it usually expands to become less dense that the surrounding fluid. The warmer fluid rises and is replaced by cooler fluid. These convection currents help distribute heat more effectively.</div>
    
        <li>Explain how <b class="Red">radiation</b> transfers heat.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Hot objects emit electromagnetic radiation which carries away energy. When the EMR is absorbed by another object the energy is absorbed. The type of EMR depends on the temperature of the emitting object. Objects close to room temperature emit infrared radiation, while objects near the temperature of the Sun emit visible light.</div>

    <li>Describe Earth’s <b class="Red">hydrologic cycle</b>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Water evaporates from oceans and through transpiration from plants. This water condenses into clouds and returns to the ground as precipitation. The water collects in streams, lakes, and rivers which return it to the sea. </div>

    <li>Describe the role of ocean currents in distributing heat on Earth.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Oceans carry warmer water from the equatorial regions to the polar regions, and return cooler water from the poles to the equator.</div>

    <li>Explain how El Nino and La Nina contribute to variations in Earth’s surface temperature.</li>
    <div class="Answer">These are changes to the South Pacific wind and ocean currents that results in heating or cooling of the surface water. This affects the weather (rain, temperature) in coastal regions of the Pacific.</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Discuss the <b class="Red">Three-Cell Model</b> of air convection (wind).</li>
        <div class="Answer">Heated air near the equator rises and flows away from the equator, being replaced at ground level by cooler air moving toward the equator. Near the poles, cool air sinks to the ground and also flows toward the equatior. In the mid-latitudes, the direction is reversed, with warmer air moving along the ground away from the equator.</div>
    
        <li>Why do we have prevailing <b class="Red">westerlies</b> throughout much of Canada?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The Coriolis effect means that currents moving north or south experience an apparent shift to the east or west due to the rotation of the Earth, which is slower at the poles and faster at the equator. Since ground air currents tend to be moving north in the mid-latitudes, the Coriolis effect produces a west-to-east motion.</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Describe the <b class="Red">jet stream</b>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The jet stream is a current of fast moving air along the boundary between warm and cool air masses.</div>
    
        <li>Explain how air convection near mountains affects weather and why water’s very high specific heat capacity is relevant.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Air cools as it rises and the moisture it contains condenses to produce precipitation on the windward side of the mountains. The air on the leeward side tends to be dryer.</p>
            <p>In coastal areas, the high heat capacity of the ocean moderates air temperatures. Warmer air over land during the day rises and is replaced by cooler sea breeze air. At night a land breeze flows from land (cooler) to sea (warmer).</p>
