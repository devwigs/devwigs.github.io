<ol>
    <li>In what kinds of organisms does photosynthesis occur?</li>
    <div class="Answer">Plants and some single-celled organisms</div>

    <li>What is the chemical equation for photosynthesis?</li>
    <div class="Answer Center">$$\mathrm{6\ CO_2 + 6\ H_2O \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\ O_2}$$
        [carbon dioxide + water &rarr; glucose + oxygen]</div>

    <li>Where in the cell (i.e. in which organelle) does photosynthesis occur?</li>
    <div class="Answer">Chloroplast</div>

    <li>Why is photosynthesis so important?</li>
    <div class="Answer">This allows the plant to store energy from sunlight which it needs to survive.</div>

    <li>What is cellular respiration? In which organelle does it occur?</li>
    <div class="Answer">This is the opposite of photosynthesis. The glucose is reacted to release the energy in the form of a chemical ATP. It occurs it the mitochondria.	</div>

    <li>What is the chemical equation for cellular respiration?</li>
    <div class="Answer">$$\mathrm{C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\ O_2 \rightarrow 6\ CO_2 + 6\ H_2O}$$</div>

    <li>How is cellular respiration similar to/different than combustion?</li>
    <div class="Answer">The reaction is very similar but it occurs much more slowly.</div>

    <li>What is ATP? What is its connection to photosynthesis and cellular respiration?</li>
    <div class="Answer">It is a chemical that the cell uses to store energy for immediate use.</div>
