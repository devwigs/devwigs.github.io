    <li>Where in the cell would you find <b class="Red">membranes</b>?</li>
    <div class="Answer">The cell membrane separates the cell from its environment. In eukaryotic cells, organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, and choroplasts are also surrounded by a membrane.</div>

    <li>Define:<ol type="a">
        <li><b class="Red">hydrophobic</b></li>
        <div class="Answer">A molecule (or one “pole” of a molecule) that repels water.</div>
        <li><b class="Red">hydrophilic</b></li>
        <div class="Answer">A molecule (or one “pole” of a molecule) that attracts water.</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li>Draw an illustration of a <b class="Red">phospholipid molecule</b>. Label the hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends.</li>
    <li>What do we mean by a <b class="Red">phospholipid bilayer</b>?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p class="Center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Cell_membrane_detailed_diagram_en.svg/800px-Cell_membrane_detailed_diagram_en.svg.png"/></p>
        <p>Phospholipid molecules contain a hydrophilic head (the spheres in the illustration) and a hydrophobic tail.
        These molecules form a“back-to-back” double layer so that the tails are kepts away from the water in the cytoplasm and surrounding the cell while the heads face toward the water.</p>

    <li>What do we mean by <b class="Red">semi-permeable</b>?</li>
    <div class="Answer">This means that some atoms, ions, and molecules can pass through the membrane while others cannot.</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Describe the <b class="Red">Fluid-Mosaic Model</b> of biological membranes.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The phospholipid molecules in the bilayer can move within the membrane like a fluid. Other molecules, such as proteins, cholesterol, and carbohydrates embedded in the bilayer can also move within the membrane.</div>
        <li>Draw an illustration of part of a membrane. Label the following parts: phospholipid bilayer, protein molecules, carbohydrate chains, cytoskeleton, cholesterol molecules.</li>
        <div class="Answer">See #4 above.</div>
    </ol></li>
