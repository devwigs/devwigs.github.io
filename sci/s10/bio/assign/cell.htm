    <li>Define <b class="Red">abiogenesis</b> and <b class="Red">biogenesis</b>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Abiogenesis is the idea that life can arise from non-living matter. Biogenesis says that life can only arise from living things.</div>

    <li>Describe <b class="Red">Redi’s experiment</b> including a diagram. State what the manipulated, responding, and controlled variables were. What was his conclusion?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Place meat (Controlled) in covered and uncovered jars (Manipulated).</p>
        <p>Maggots (Responding) appear only in the uncovered jar.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: Maggots did not arise from the meat but from the flies.</p>
    </div>

    <li>Describe the contributions to cell theory of:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Robert Hooke</li>
        <div class="Answer">Saw cork cells in a primitive microscope and coined the term “cell”.	</div>

        <li>Anton von Leeuwenhoek</li>
        <div class="Answer">Improved the microscope design and saw single-celled organisms in his microscope.</div>

        <li>Louis Pasteur</li>
        <div class="Answer">Demonstrated that microorganisms caused food spoilage but did not arise from the food itself.</div>

        <li>Rudolf Virchow</li>
        <div class="Answer">Concluded that cells are created from pre-existing cells.</div>

        <li>Schleiden & Schwann</li>
        <div class="Answer">Concluded that all plant and animal tissues are composed of cells.</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li>State the three basic principles of <b class="Red">cell theory</b>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <ol>
            <li>All organisms (life) are composed of one or more cells.</li>
            <li>The cell is the smallest functional unit of life.</li>
            <li>All cells are produced from other cells.</li>
