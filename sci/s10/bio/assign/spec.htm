    <li>Explain the difference between unicellular and multicellular organisms.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Unicellular organisms consist of a single cell that must perform all of the organism’s functions. Multicellular organisms consist of many cells that are specialized to perform only certain of life’s functions.</div>

    <li>Define:<ol type="a">
        <li>tissue</li>
        <li>organ</li>
        <li>system</li>
    </ol></li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>tissue: Cells of a similar type and function (e.g. muscle, palisade cells)</p>
        <p>organ: Different tissues that work together to perform a specific function(s) for the organism (e.g. liver, leaf)</p>
        <p>system: One or more organs and tissues that function together to meet the organism’s needs (e.g. vascular or circulatory system)</p>
    </div>

    <li>Describe four different tissues that are present in plant leaves.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Epidermis: a layer of cells covering the outside of the leaf</p>
        <p>Palisade: a tightly packed layer(s) of cells where photosynthesis occurs</p>
        <p>Spongy Mesophyll: a loosely packed region that allows for gas exchange</p>
        <p>Guard Cells: cells that open and close the stomata to regulate gas exchange</p>
        <p>Xylem/Phloem: cells responsible for water / sap transport</p>
    </div>

    <li>Identify three plant organs.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Leaf, Root, Stem, Flower</div>

    <li>Identify three animal organs.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Heart, Liver, Brain, Lung, Skin, Kidney</div>
</ol>
