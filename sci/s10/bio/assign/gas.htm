        <li>What are the <b class="Red">stomata</b>? Where are they found? What is their function?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Openings in the bottom of the leaf that allow gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, water) in and out.</div>

        <li>Draw a labelled illustration of a stoma with its guard cells.</li>
    
    </ol></li>

    <li>Define <b class="Red">transpiration</b>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Evaporation of water from the leaf.</div>

    <li>Explain how the <b class="Red">guard cells</b> respond to wet or dry conditions to regulate gas exchange.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Turgor pressure (wet conditions) causes these cells to expand which opens the stomata. Plasmolysis (dry conditions) cause the cells to shrink which closes the stomata.</div>

    <li>Describe three important gases that need to be exchanged for the plant to remain healthy and explain how each gas is related to photosynthesis or cellular respiration.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Oxygen: Produced by photosynthesis and consumed by cellular respiration.	</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide: Consumed by photosynthesis and produced by cellular respiration.	</p>
        <p>Water: Consumed by photosynthesis and produced by cellular respiration.</p>
    </div>

    <li>What is a <b class="Red">lenticel</b> and what is its role in gas exchange?</li>
    <div class="Answer">A small hole in the trunk of a tree or woody plant that promotes gas exchange.</div>
