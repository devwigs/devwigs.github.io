<h3>Practice</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>A synthetic (non-biological) semi-permeable membrane is designed to permit the diffusion of molecules up to and including the size of glucose. Larger molecules like starch and proteins cannot pass through the membrane. On each diagram, draw and label arrows showing the direction of motion of all molecules (including water) that are able to pass through the membrane.</p>

    </li>
    <div class="Answer Center"><img src="s10/bio/assign/img/osmosis2.png"/></div>
    <li>A semipermeable membrane is used as a container. A solution containing 10% iodine (a small molecule) is poured inside the membrane. The membrane is sealed and is then inserted into a beaker containing 1% starch (a large molecule). When starch and iodine mix, a dark purple colour is produced.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>After a few minutes, will the solution inside the membrane turn purple? Will the solution outside the membrane turn purple? Explain.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Since starch is a large molecule, it is unable to pass through the membrane into the container so the interior will not turn purple. Iodine is a small molecule so it will diffuse out from the container into the surroundings which will turn purple because there is already starch there.</div>

        <li>Will the membrane shrink or expand? Explain.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The membrane is likely to expand as water enters the container through osmosis. This happens because there is a higher concentration of solute (lower concentration of water) inside compared to the “hypotonic” surroundings.</div>
