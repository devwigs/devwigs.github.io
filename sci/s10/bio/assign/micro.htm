    <div class="Answer">
        1 = Revolving Nosepiece<br/>
        2 = Objective Lens<br/>
        3 = Ocular Lens (Eyepiece)<br/>
        4 = Stage / Diaphragm / Stage Clips<br/>
        5 = Coarse Focus<br/>
        6 = Fine Focus<br/>
        7 = Light Source
    </div>

    <li>Define <b class="Red">magnification</b> and explain how to calculate the total magnification of a compound light microscope.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Magnification is the ratio of the size of the image we see compared to the actual size of the object we are looking at. The magnification of a compound light microscope is the product of the objective lens magnification and the ocular lens (eyepiece) magnification.</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Define <b class="Red">field of view</b> and explain how it relates to the magnification and image size.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Field of view represents the total actual size of what we can see under the microscope. The image size is the product of the field of view and the total magnification.</div>

        <li>How can we measure the field of view under low magnification?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Under low magnification, you can observe the field of view directly by placing a transparent plastic ruler under the microscope.</div>

        <li>How can we calculate the field of view for medium and high magnification?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The field of view gets smaller when you increase the magnification, but the image size remains constant. This means you can calculate the image size under low magnification by multiplying the FoV by the magnification, and then divide that image size by the higher magnifications to get the FoV.</div>

        <li>How can we estimate the size of an object seen under a microscope?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Estimate how many of the object would need to be placed end-to-end equal the diameter of the image. Divide the Fov by this number to get the size of each such object.</div>

    <li>Describe three other types of microscopes besides compound light microscopes.</li>

<h3>Practice</h3>
<ol>
    <li>A microscope has an ocular lens with a magnification of 12 and a “low” power objective lens with a magnification of 5. A student places a ruler on the stage and observes that the field of view is 6.0 mm.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the total magnification.</li>
        <div class="Answer">12 × 5 = 60</div>

        <li>Calculate the image size.</li>
        <div class="Answer">60 × 6.0 mm = 360 mm</div>

        <li>The student increases the magnification by changing to a 20× “medium” power objective lens. Calculate the new magnification.</li>
        <div class="Answer">12 × 20 = 240</div>

        <li>Calculate the new field of view under medium power.</li>
        <div class="Answer">360 mm / 240 = 1.5 mm</div>

        <li>Calculate the magnification and field of view under high magnification with an object lens magnification of 50.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            Magnification = 12 × 50 = 600<br/>FoV = Image Size / Magnification = 360 mm / 600 = 0.60 mm	
        </div>

        <li>Students view a leaf under high magnification and observe that there are about 50 leaf “cells” across. How large is each leaf cell?</li>
        <div class="Answer">0.60 mm / 50 = 0.012 mm</div>
