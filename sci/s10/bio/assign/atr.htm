    <li>Define and give examples of <b class="Red">active transport</b>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Motion of substances across a membrane that requires energy. This happens when material needs to moved from lower to higher concentration. Passive transport (no energy needed) only works from high to low. Examples of active transport include endocytosis and exocytosis.</div>

    <li>Define <b class="Red">endocytosis</b> and draw an illustration.</li>
    <div class="Answer">This is when the membrane engulfs the material to be brought into the cell. The membrane “pit” pinches off to form a vesicle.</div>

    <li>Define <b class="Red">exocytosis</b> and draw an illustration.</li>
    <div class="Answer">This is the reverse of endocytosis, where a vesicle containing material to be moved outside the cell joins to the cell membrane and expels the material.</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Define <b class="Red">phagocytosis</b>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Endocytosis where the material entering the cell is solid (food)</div>
    
        <li>Define <b class="Red">pinocytosis</b>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Endocytosis where the material entering the cell is liquid (water)</div>
    </ol></li>

    <!--li>Why is there a limit to how big a cell can be before it becomes unsustainable?</li>
    <div class="Answer">As a cell gets bigger, it becomes harder to move enough materials (oxygen, water, CO<sub>2</sub>, waste) through the membrane</div-->
