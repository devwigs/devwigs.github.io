        <li>tropism</li>
        <div class="Answer">A plant’s response to stimuli</div>
    
        <li>phototropism</li>
        <div class="Answer">A plant’s response to light; i.e. it will grow so that its leaves are pointed toward light</div>
    
        <li>positive gravitropism</li>
        <div class="Answer">Growth of the root in the same direction as gravity (down)</div>
    
        <li>negative gravitropism</li>
        <div class="Answer">Growth of the stem in the opposite direction as gravity (up)</div>
    
        <li>nastic response</li>
        <div class="Answer">Response to touch (as in carnivorous plants)</div>

    </ol></li>

    <li>Explain what an auxin is and its role in plant tropisms. Include an illustration for phototropism.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Auxin is a hormone (chemical that stimulates growth). Cells in the plant’s stem use active transport to move auxin from the light side to the shady side. The cells on the shady side grow faster causing the stem to bend toward the light.</div>
