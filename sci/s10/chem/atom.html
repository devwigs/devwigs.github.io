    <h3>Atoms</h3>
    <p>Democritus (c. 400 BCE) proposed that if a pure substance were divided into smaller and smaller pieces,
        eventually we would arrive at something so small it could be divided no further.</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-mark="1">The smallest piece of a pure substance is called an <em class="Defn">atom</em>.</li>
        <li data-mark="2">The word atom comes from the Greek word <span class="Blue">ἄτομον</span>, for <em>indivisible</em> or <em>uncuttable</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Billiard Ball Model</h3>
    <p>John Dalton (1808) proposed the first modern model of the atom.</p>
    <ul data-mark="0">
        <li data-mark="1">Atoms are the smallest (indivisible) particle of all matter.</li>
        <li data-mark="2">Atoms of the same element have the same size and mass.</li>
        <li data-mark="3">Different elements have atoms of different size and mass.</li>
        <li data-mark="4">In Dalton’s model, atoms have no internal parts; they are featureless spheres (like a <em class="Defn">billiard ball</em>).</li>
    </ul>
    <ul data-mark="5">
        <li>Compounds are created when atoms of different elements join together in definite proportions (e.g. H<sub>2</sub>O).</li>
        <li data-mark="6">Dalton’s model explains why chemical reactions occur in definite proportions; running electricity through water creates hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 ratio.</li>
        <li data-mark="7">Dalton’s model also explains thermal properties of matter such as pressure and temperature.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul data-mark="8">
        <li>The Billiard Ball model does <em>not</em> explain the electrical properties of matter.</li>
        <li data-mark="9">Matter has positive and negative parts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Raisin Bun Model</h3>
    <p data-mark="0">J.J. Thomson performed experiments (1897) to see how positive and negative matter were affected by electric and magnetic forces. He concluded:</p>
    <ul data-mark="1">
        <li>The negative parts of matter have much smaller mass than the positive parts.</li>
        <li data-mark="2">The mass of the positive parts depends on the element (same as Dalton’s model).</li>
        <li data-mark="3">The mass of the negative parts will always be the same, regardless of which element the negative part came from!</li>
        <li data-mark="4">These negative parts, common to all elements, are called <em class="Defn">electrons</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-mark="5">Thomson (1904) proposed the <em class="Defn">Raisin Bun</em> or <em class="Defn">Plum Pudding</em> model.</p>
    <p data-mark="5" class="Center"><img src="img/bun.png" alt="Atom" class="w10"/></p>
    <ul data-mark="5">
        <li data-mark="5">The “bun” is a sphere containing most of the atom’s mass.</li>
        <li data-mark="6">Like the Billiard Ball model, the size and mass of the atom differ from one element to another.</li>
        <li data-mark="7">There are electrons (“raisins”) embedded in the atom (“bun”) that have a very small mass and a negative charge.</li>
        <li data-mark="8">Different elements have differing numbers of electrons, but the electrons all have the same properties regardless of which element they come from.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Planetary (Nuclear) Model</h3>
    <p data-mark="0">Ernest Rutherford and his students performed an experiment (1909) where they fired small, high-speed, positive particles at a thin gold foil. (Gold is a large atom.)</p>
    <ul data-mark="1">
        <li data-mark="1">Most of these “alpha” particles passed through the gold foil with nearly no effect.</li>
        <li data-mark="2">A very small percentage of the alpha particles were deflected by the gold foil to very large angles.</li>
        <li data-mark="3">Rutherford concluded that the Raisin Bun model could not explain these results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-mark="4">Rutherford proposed a new model called the <em>Planetary Model</em> (also called the “solar system” or “nuclear” model.)</p>
    <p data-mark="5" class="Center"><img src="img/nuke.png" alt="Atom" class="w16"/></p>
    <ul data-mark="5">
        <li data-mark="5">Most of the atom is empty space, since the alpha particles were unaffected.</li>
        <li data-mark="6">Most of the atom’s mass is concentrated in a tiny <em class="Defn">nucleus</em>, which cause some of the alpha particles to deflect.</li>
        <li data-mark="7">The electrons orbit around the nucleus like the planets orbiting the Sun.</li>
        <li data-mark="8">To account for measurements of atomic mass and charge, the nucleus must contain two kinds of particle...</li>
        <ul data-mark="9">
            <li data-mark="9">Protons have a positive charge.</li>
            <li data-mark="10">Neutrons have no charge.</li>
            <li data-mark="11">Protons and neutrons have nearly the same mass.</li>
        </ul>
        <li data-mark="12">The nucleus has a diameter of about \(\mathrm{10^{-14}\ m}\) depending on the element.</li>
        <li data-mark="13">The electron orbits have diameters on the order of \(\mathrm{10^{-10}\ m}\).</li>
