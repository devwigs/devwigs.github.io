<h3>Review</h3>
<ol>
<li>Explain the difference between:
<ol type="a">
    <li>element and compound</li>
    <div class="Answer">Elements contain only one type of atom (e.g. iron) while compounds consist of molecules or crystals made from two or more different types of atoms (e.g. NaCl or H<sub>2</sub>O)</div>

    <li>pure substance and mixture</li>
    <div class="Answer">A pure substance contains only one kind of material (either an element or a compound) while a mixture contains two or more pure substances (e.g. NaCl dissolved in water).</div>

    <li>homogeneous and heterogeneous mixture</li>
    <div class="Answer">A homogeneous mixture (solution) is mixed uniformly (the properties are the same everywhere) while a heterogeneous mixture is non-uniform (there are regions with different properties).</div>

</ol>
</li>

<li>What are the different components of a solution called?</li>
<div class="Answer">
    <p>Solvent: Substance that dissolves the solute	</p>
    <p>Solute: Substance that is dissolved in the solvent</p>
</div>

<li>The components of a mixture can be separated using different methods. Describe the following methods.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Distillation</li>
    <div class="Answer">Heat the mixture until one of the substances boils and evaporates</div>
    <li>Paper Chromatography</li>
    <div class="Answer">Different substances will move up the paper at different rates.</div>
    <li>Filtration</li>
    <div class="Answer">Separate solids from liquids or two solids of different particle sizes using a filter</div>
</ol>
</li>

<ol type="a">
    <li>Candle wax</li>
    <li>An egg</li>
    <li>Ice cubes floating in water</li>
    <li>Silver nitrate solution</li>
</ol>
</li>

    <p>Homogeneous: Silver nitrate solution</p>
    <p>Heterogeneous: Egg, Candle wax</p>
</div>

<li>A physical change alters a substance without changing its composition. A chemical change results in one or more substances being changes into new substances. Identify each example below as either a physical or chemical change.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Rusting of iron</li>
    <li>Burning coal</li>
    <li>Condensing water vapour</li>
    <li>Food spoilage</li>
    <li>Bending copper wire into a coil</li>
    <li>Shattering an ice cube</li>
    <li>Roasting a turkey</li>
    <li>Frost forming on a windowpane</li>
</ol></li>
<div class="Answer">
    <p>Chemical: Rusting of iron, Burning coal, Food spoilage, Roasting a turkey</p>
    <p>Physical: Condensing water vapour, Bending wire, Shattering an ice cube, Frost forming</p>

<ol type="a">
   <li>Bromine boils at 59 °C</li>
   <li>Sulfuric acid is a strong acid</li>
   <li>Wood can be burned</li>
   <li>Wood can be split</li>
   <li>Water is densest at 4 °C</li>
   <li>Helium doesn’t react with anything</li>
</ol>
</li>
<div class="Answer">
    <p>Chemical: Strong acid, Can be burned, Doesn’t react</p>
    <p>Physical: Boiling point, Can be split, Density</p>
</div>

<li>Write a procedure that could be used to separate a mixture of sand and sugar.</li>
<div class="Answer">
<ul>
    <li>Add warm water to the mixture to dissolve the sugar.</li>
    <li>Use a filter to remove the sand.</li>
    <li>Use distillation to remove the water, leaving sugar behind.</li>
</ul>
</div>
