        <li>Define an <b class="Red">acid</b>.</li>
        <li>State some properties of acids.</li>

    <div class="Answer">
        <p>An acid is a compound that causes the concentration of hydrogen cations (H<sup>+</sup>) to increase when it is dissolved in water.</p>
        <p>Acids are corrosive and sour.</p>

        <li>Define an <b class="Red">base</b>.</li>
        <li>State some properties of bases.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>A base is a compound that causes the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH<sup>–</sup>) to increase when it is dissolved in water.</p>
        <p>Bases are corrosive, bitter, and slippery.</p>

    <li>There are alternative definitions of acids and bases. Who was the chemist that came up with the above definitions?</li>
    <div class="Answer">Arrhenius</div>

        <li>What does <b class="Red">pH</b> stand for?</li>
        <li>Explain how the pH scale works.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>pH stands for power of hydrogen.</p>
        <p>In pure water, one “mole” of water molecules out of every ten million (10<sup>7</sup>) litres will break apart to create	
a H<sup>+</sup> and a OH<sup>–</sup> ion. Both ions have a concentration of 10<sup>–7</sup> “moles per litre”.  We define the pH of pure	
(neutral) water as 7.  When we add acid to the water, the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> goes up.  A	
pH of 6, for example, means 10 times more H<sup>+</sup> ions compared to pure water. Acids	
always have a pH lower than 7. Bases increase the concentration of OH<sup>–</sup> and decrease the	
concentration of H<sup>+</sup>; they have pH greater than 7.

        <li>What is an <b class="Red">indicator</b>?</li>
        <li>What are some common indicators?</li>
    </ol></li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>An indicator is a substance that changes colour as the pH changes.</p>
        <p>Litmus paper, bromothymol blue, phenolphthalein, and methyl orange are indicator commonly used in high school chemistry labs.</p>
