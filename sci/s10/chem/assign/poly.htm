    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Explain what a <b class="Red">polyatomic ion</b> is.</li>
        <div class="Answer">It is a group of covalently bonded atoms that share a net charge. This allows them to form an ionic compound with ions of the opposite charge.</div>

        <li>Where would you find the names, formulas, and charges for the more common polyatomic ions?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Many periodic tables include a smaller table of polyatomic ions.</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Explain how to determine the name and chemical formula for a polyatomic ionic compound.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Like binary ionic compounds, polyatomic ionic compounds are named by combining the cation name (first) and anion name (last); e.g. ammonium sulfate.</div>
    
        <li>Explain the use of parentheses in the chemical formula for some polyatomic ionic compounds.</li>
        <div class="Answer">If the cation and anion charges are unequal, you will need to have more than one of each to balance the charge. If multiple polyatomic ions are needed, parentheses are used around the ion and the proportion subscript is written outside the closing parenthesis.; e.g. \(\mathrm{(NH_4)_2 SO_4}\)</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Define <b class="Red">solubility</b>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The ability of the substance to dissolve in a solvent (usually water). High solubility means the substance dissolves (nearly) completely and low solubility means the substance remains (mostly) undissolved.</div>

        <li>Explain how to determine the solubility in water of various ionic compounds.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Find either the cation or anion among the column headings. Locate the other ion in either the “high” or “low” solubility row.</div>
    </ol></li>
