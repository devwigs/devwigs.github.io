<h3>Dalton’s Model</h3>
<ol>
    <li>What is the “nickname” of Dalton’s atomic model?</li>
    <div class="Answer">“Billiard Ball” Model</div>

    <li>Draw an illustration of Dalton’s model and describe its key features, including the parts of the atom (if any) and an explanation of what makes one element different from another (e.g. carbon from hydrogen).</li>
    <div class="Answer">
    <p class="Center"><img src="s10/chem/img/billiard.png" alt="Dalton atom"/></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Atoms are uniform spheres (like a billiard ball!) with no parts.</li>
        <li>Atoms of the same element have the same mass and size.</li>
        <li>Atoms of different elements are different sizes; carbon atoms are larger than hydrogen atoms.</li>
        <li>Compounds are formed by atoms of different elements joining; a molecule of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is one oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms.</li>
    </ul></div>

    <li>Explain the evidence that caused Dalton to propose this model. In other words, what observable facts can we understand by using Dalton’s model? </li>
    <div class="Answer"><ul>
        <li>Some elements (e.g. oxygen and nitrogen) can form multiple compounds (e.g. NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O)</li>
        <li>When water is decomposed, it will produce two parts hydrogen to one part oxygen.</li>
        <li>We can understand thermal concepts like temperature and pressure...</li>
        <li>Temperature measures the energy of the molecules while pressure measures the force they exert on their neighbours.</li>
        </ul></div>

<h3>Thomson’s Model</h3>
<ol>
    <li>What are the nicknames of Thomson’s atomic model?</li>
    <div class="Answer">“Raisin Bun” or “Plum Pudding” Model</div>

    <li>Draw an illustration of Thomson’s model and describe its key features, including the parts of the atom (if any) and an explanation of what makes one element different from another.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
    <p class="Center"><img src="s10/chem/img/bun.png" alt="Thomson atom"/></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The mass of the atom is almost entirely positively charged (the “bun”).</li>
        <li>Tiny, negatively charged “electrons” are embedded throughout the atom (the “raisins”).</li>
        <li>Atoms of different elements have different numbers of electrons as well as different sizes.</li>
    </ul></div>

    <li>Explain the evidence that caused Thomson to propose this model to replace Dalton’s.</li>
    <div class="Answer"><ul>
        <li>Dalton’s model could not explain the electrical properties of matter.</li>
        <li>Thomson’s experiments with cathode ray tubes showed that electric and magnetic forces cause <em>much</em> greater deflection of negative particles compared to positive particles at the same speed.</li>
        <li>Therefore, the negative particles must be much smaller!</li>
    </ul></div>
</ol>

<h3>Rutherford’s Model</h3>
<ol>
    <li>What are the nicknames of Rutherford’s atomic model?</li>
    <div class="Answer">“Planetary” or “Solar System” or “Nuclear” Model</div>

    <li>Draw an illustration of Rutherford’s model and describe its key features, including the parts of the atom (if any) and an explanation of what makes one element different from another.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
    <p class="Center"><img src="s10/chem/img/nuke.png" alt="Rutherford atom"/></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The atom is mostly empty space!</li>
        <li>The positive charge and almost all the mass of the atom is in a tiny but massive “nucleus”.</li>
        <li>The negatively charged electrons orbit around the nucleus like planets around the Sun.</li>
        <li>The nucleus is made of protons (positive) and neutrons (no charge).</li>
    </ul></div>

    <li>Explain the evidence that caused Rutherford to propose this model to replace Thomson’s.</li>
    <div class="Answer"><ul>
        <li>Scattering experiments using alpha particles and thin metal (gold or aluminum) foils...</li>
        <li>Most alpha particles were undeflected, showing the atom is mostly empty.</li>
        <li>A small number of alpha particles were deflected by a very large angle, showing that something really massive and positive (the nucleus) repelled them.</li>
    </ul></div>
</ol>
