    <li>Describe <b class="Red">oxidation</b> and <b class="Red">combustion</b> reactions.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Oxidation is the reaction of an element or compound with oxygen to produce oxides.  Rapid, exothermic oxidation reactions are called combustion.  Slower oxidation reactions include the rusting of iron or other metals.</div>

    <li>Describe <b class="Red">hydrocarbon combustion</b>.</li>
