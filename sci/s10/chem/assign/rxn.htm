<h3>Review</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Define and explain what happens during a <b class="Red">chemical reaction</b>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Chemical bonds (ionic or covalent) are broken and new bonds are formed instead. The result is a change in the type of substance(s) present.</div>

    <li>Define:<ol type="a">
        <li><b class="Red">reactant</b></li>
        <div class="Answer">A substance that is present before the reaction that will be changed into something else</div>

        <li><b class="Red">product</b></li>
        <div class="Answer">A substance that is produced by the chemical reaction</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li>List three observations that would constitute evidence that a chemical reaction has occurred.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Change in temperature; change of colour; production of a gas; production of a precipitate</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>State the <b class="Red">First Law of Thermodynamics</b>, also called <b class="Red">Law of Energy Conservation</b>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Energy can be transformed from one form to another but the total energy must always remain constant</div>
    
        <li>Define an <b class="Red">endothermic</b> and an <b class="Red">exothermic</b> reaction.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Reactions that convert thermal energy (heat) into chemical energy are endothermic; they cause a temperature drop.  Exothermic reactions transform chemical energy into thermal energy and result in a temperature rise	</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li>What is the source of energy that is released in an exothermic reaction? What absorbs the energy that is released? In other words, where does the energy come from and where does it go?</li>
    <div class="Answer">The source of the energy is the chemical energy of the reactants. The products of an exothermic Reaction have less energy than the reactants. The difference is released into the surroundings as thermal energy (heat), light, and/or sound.</div>

    <li>What is the source of energy that is absorbed in an endothermic reaction?</li>
    <div class="Answer">The source of energy is the surroundings. Thermal energy is taken from the surroundings (causing the temperature to drop) and added to the reactantsâ€™ chemical energy. The products will have more chemical energy than the reactants.</div>

    <li>A student claims that the reaction of butane gas and oxygen must be endothermic since a spark is required to ignite butane lighter. Do you agree or disagree? Explain.</li>
    <div class="Answer">It does take a bit of energy to start the reaction, since the existing chemical bonds in the reactants Need to be broken. However, the amount of energy released when the products are formed is much greater. The reaction is classified as exothermic.</div>
