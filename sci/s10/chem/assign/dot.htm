<h3>Review</h3>
<ol>
<li>Define the following terms:
<ol type="a">
    <li>Periodicity</li>
    <div class="Answer">Periodicity refers to the idea that something (such as the properties of the elements) repeats on a regular basis.</div>

    <li>Group (Family)</li>
    <div class="Answer">The elements within the same column of the periodic table are called groups (or families) and tend to have similar properties.</div>

    <li>Period</li>
    <div class="Answer">The elements within the same row of the periodic table are called periods.</div>

    <li>Phase (State)</li>
    <div class="Answer">The phase or state of a substance means whether it is in the form of a solid, liquid, or gas.</div>
</ol>
</li>

<li>State the essential properties of the following categories of element and where they would be found in the Periodic Table.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Metals</li>
    <div class="Answer">Metals tend to be ductile and malleable solids (at SATP) that conduct electricity; they are found to the left of the “staircase” in the periodic table.</div>

    <li>Non-Metals</li>
    <div class="Answer">Non-metals tend to be non-ductile and non-malleable; less likely than metals to be solid or conductors; they are found to the right of the staircase in the periodic table.</div>

    <li>Metalloids</li>
    <div class="Answer">Metalloids have some properties of both metals and non-metals; they are found adjacent to the staircase in the periodic table.</div>

    <li>Noble (Inert) Gases</li>
    <div class="Answer">Noble gases (also called inert gases) are elements found in Group 18; they are very non-reactive gases.</div>

    <li>Halogens</li>
    <div class="Answer">Halogens are elements from Group 17; they are highly reactive non-metals.</div>

    <li>Alkali Metals</li>
    <div class="Answer">Alkali metals are from Group 1; they are highly reactive metals.	</div>
</ol>
</li>

<li>On your Science 10 Data Booklet periodic table, use colours, labels, arrows, lines, etc. to identify the following:
<ol type="a">
    <li>“Staircase”</li>
    <li>Non-Metals</li>
    <li>Noble (Inert) Gases</li>
    <li>Halogens</li>
    <li>Metalloids</li>
    <li>Metals</li>
    <li>Alkali Metals</li>
    <li>Alkali Earth Metals</li>
    <li>Transition Metals</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Explain what a “Lewis dot diagram” (also called an electron dot diagram) is, how to draw one, and why it is important.
<div class="Answer">An illustration of an atom or ion’s <b>valence</b> electrons. These electrons, and how they are paired, determines the chemical behaviour of the atom.</div>
</li>
</ol>
