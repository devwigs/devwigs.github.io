<h3>Review</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Define:<ol type="a">
        <li>binary compound</li>
        <div class="Answer">A pure substance composed of atoms of two different elements.</div>

        <li>covalent bond</li>
        <div class="Answer">Atoms <em>share</em> electrons and form molecules, held together by the shared attraction.</div>

        <li>ionic bond</li>
        <div class="Answer">Electrons are <em>transferred</em> between atoms; the ions form a lattice due to the attraction/repulsion between them.</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li>Describe the <b class="Red">7+1 Rule</b>. Also, identify the two elements that form polyatomic molecules.</li>
    <div class="Answer">The seven elements in the shape of a seven, starting at element 7, all form diatomic molecules, as does hydrogen. The two elements below the top of the 7 are polyatomic (P<sub>4</sub>, S<sub>8</sub>).</div>

    <li>Explain why atoms form covalent or ionic bonds.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Atoms like to gain, lose, or share valence electrons so that they have completely full valence levels.</div>

    <li>Explain how binary molecular compounds are named under the IUPAC system.</li>
    <div class="Answer">The name of the element furthest left in the periodic table comes first, followed by the second element with the suffix changed to -ide. Prefixes (mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, etc.) are used to indicate how many of each atom are contained in each molecule. The prefix mono- is omitted only on the first part of the name.</div>

    <li>Compare the properties of ionic compounds to those of molecular compounds.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Ionic compounds, if they dissolve in water, are more likely to conduct electricity. Ionic compounds also tend to exist as solid crystals with high melting points.</div>

</ol>

<h3>Practice</h3>
<ol>
    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>A compound dissolves in water. The resulting solution is found to be a good conductor of electricity. Is the compound more likely to be ionic or molecular?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Ionic</div>

        <li>A compound dissolves in water. The resulting solution is found to be a non-conductor. Is the compound more likely to be ionic or molecular?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Molecular</div>

        <li>A compound does not dissolve in water. Is the compound more likely to be ionic or molecular?</li>
        <div class="Answer">There is no way to tell... there are insoluble compounds for both ionic and molecular types.</div>
