    <li>Define a binary ionic compound and explain how the atoms are held together in these compounds.</li>
    <div class="Answer">A compound formed from atoms of two different elements. One element forms a positive ion and the other a negative ion. They are held together because their opposite charges attract. This is called an ionic bond.</div>

    <li>Define cation and anion.</li>
    <div class="Answer">The cation is positive ion and the anion is the negative ion.</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>State the Law of Conservation of Electric Charge and explain how it affects ionic compounds involving ions with unequal charges.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The total charge must remain constant. This means that for an ionic compound, the charge of the cation must exactly balance the charge of the anion.</div>
        
        <li>Explain how to determine the chemical formula for an ionic compound.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Compare the charges of the ions. The total positive charge and the total negative charge must be the LCM of the cation and anion charges.</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li>Explain how to name binary ionic compounds. Specifically include how to name compounds involving elements that can form more than one ion.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Give the name of the cation first. If the element has more than one possible ion, include the ion charge as a roman numeral such as “iron(III)” or “iron(II)”. The anion name, with the suffix “-ide”, goes second.</div>
