    <li>Describe the shape of a water molecule.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Water molecules have an angular shape like a “V” as suggested by the Lewis dot diagram. The angle between the two bonds is 104°.</div>

    <li>Explain what we mean when we say that water is a <b class="Red">polar</b> molecule. Describe one piece of evidence that water is polar.</li>
    <div class="Answer">The shared electrons in the covalent bond are attracted more to the oxygen than to the hydrogen atom. This means that the oxygen end of the molecule is slightly negative and the hydrogen end is slightly positive. This explains why water molecules are attracted to electric charges.</div>

    <li>Explain what a <b class="Red">hydrogen bond</b> and why these bonds are significant for water.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Because the hydrogen atoms do not get a “full share” of the electrons, they are attracted to unshared pairs of electrons in neighbouring molecules. This strong attraction between water molecules means that it takes a lot of energy to heat water or to change it from a solid to a liquid. Water also has a high surface tension and an ability to cohere to substances with unshared electron pairs, such as the oxygen atoms of the SiO<sub>2</sub> molecules in glass.</div>
    
    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Ice floats in liquid water. This is unusual as most substances are denser as solids than liquids. Why does water exhibit this weird property?</li>
        <li>Why is this property of water important for living things?</li>
    </ol></li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>The shape of the water molecule and the strong hydrogen bonds cause the molecules to form a hexagonal structure as a solid that contains lots of space in the centre. This space makes the density of solid water relatively low. When ice melts, the space becomes occupied and the liquid will be denser than the solid.</p>
        <p>Bodies of water will freeze from the top since ice is less dense than liquid water. The ice will insulate the liquid water below, preventing the lake or pond from freezing completely during winter.</p>
    </div>

    <li>List some additional properties of water resulting from its strong hydrogen bonds.</li>
    <div class="Answer">High surface tension / cohesion, High heat capacity, Strong solvent, High melting and boiling point (for a molecular substance)</div>
