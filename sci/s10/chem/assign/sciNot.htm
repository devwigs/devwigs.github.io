<h3>Review</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Explain what we mean by <b class="Red">decimal notation</b> and <b class="Red">scientific notation</b>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">The normal way of writing numbers is called decimal notation. With scientific notation, we move the decimal place so that it immediately follows after the first non-zero digit. We then use a power of 10 top indicate how many places the decimal was moved. This allows us to omit any leading or trailing placeholder zeroes.</div>

    <li>Why is scientific notation useful?</li>
    <div class="Answer"> It allows us to write very large or very small numbers with fewer digits.</div>

    <li>Explain how to use the exponential “shorthand” when using a computer or scientific calculator. How does this shorthand make things easier?</li>
    <div class="Answer">Use the “EE” button to indicate scientific notation. For example, to enter \(1.23\times 10^4\), type \(1.23{\small E}4\)</div>

<h3>Practice</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a hydrogen atom, the electron orbits with a radius of $$\mathrm{0.000\ 000\ 000\ 052\ 9 m}$$ Express this radius using scientific notation.</li>
    <div class="Answer">\(\mathrm{5.29 \times 10^{-11}\ m}\)</div>

    <li>Earth has a mass of \(\mathrm{5.98\times 10^{24}\ kg}\). Express this mass using decimal notation.</li>
    <div class="Answer">\(\mathrm{5\ 980\ 000\ 000\ 000\ 000\ 000\ 000\ 000\ kg}\)</div>

    <li>In physics, the kinetic energy of a moving object (measured in joules, J) is calculated using the formula:
    $$E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
    In this formula, \(m\) is the object’s mass in kilograms and \(v\) is the object’s speed in metres per second. Calculate the kinetic energy of a \(\mathrm{5.00\times 10^{12}\ kg}\) asteroid hurtling towards Earth at \(\mathrm{8.20\times 10^4\ m/s}\). Show all steps!</li>
    <div class="Answer">$$\begin{align}E_k &= \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\\ &= \mathrm{\frac{1}{2}(5.00\times 10^{12}\ kg) (8.20\times 10^4\ m/s)^2}
\\ &= \mathrm{1.68\times 10^{22}\ J}\end{align}$$</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate how many seconds there are in a year. Express your answer in scientific notation. (Hint: How many days are there in a year? How many hours in a day? How many seconds in an hour?)</li>
        <div class="Answer">\(\mathrm{365.24\ days \times 24\ hours/day \times 60\ min/hour \times 60\ s/min \\= 3.16\times 10^7\ s}\)</div>

        <li>In astronomy, a light-year is the distance that light travels in one year. This can be calculated using the formula:
$$\Delta d=c\Delta t$$
In this formula, \(c\) is the speed of light (\(\mathrm{3.00\times 10^8\ m/s}\)) and \(\Delta t\) is the time in seconds. Use the formula to calculate how far a light-year is in metres.
</li>
    <div class="Answer">$$\Delta d = \mathrm{(3.00\times 10^8\ m/s) (3.16\times 10^7\ s) = 9.47\times 10^{15}\ m}$$</div>
    </ol></li>

<li>In geometry, the surface area of a sphere is calculated using the formula: $$A=4\pi r^2$$ where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Using Earth’s radius of 6.37 × 10<sup>6</sup> m, calculate the Earth’s surface area. Use the \(\pi\) button on your calculator (rather than typing in the value of \(\pi\)) to avoid unnecessary rounding errors.</li>
    <div class="Answer">$$\begin{align}
A &= 4\pi r^2
\\ &= 4\pi(\mathrm{6.37\times 10^6\ m})^2
\\ &= \mathrm{5.10\times 10^{14}\ m^2}
\end{align}$$</div>

    <li>Earth’s atmosphere produces an average air pressure of 101 300 Pa at sea level. The symbol ‘Pa’ stands for pascals, the unit of pressure. Express this air pressure using scientific notation.</li>
    <div class="Answer">\(\mathrm{1.013\times 10^5\ Pa}\)</div>

    <li>The total weight of Earth’s atmosphere can be calculated by multiplying atmospheric pressure by Earth’s surface area. Calculate the weight (in newtons, N) of Earth’s atmosphere.</li>
    <div class="Answer">$$\mathrm{(1.013\times 10^5\ Pa) (5.10\times 10^{14}\ m^2) = 5.17\times 10^{19}\ N}$$</div>

    <li>Carbon dioxide plays an important role in the greenhouse effect (which we will study in Unit 4). Carbon dioxide makes up only about 410 parts per million (0.041%) of the molecules in the atmosphere. Each carbon dioxide molecule is about 1.6 times as heavy as the molecules that make up most of the atmosphere, so CO<sub>2</sub> represents about 0.066% of the atmosphere’s weight. Calculate the total weight. of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.</li>
    <div class="Answer">$$\mathrm{\frac{0.066\%}{100\%}\ (5.17\times 10^{19}\ N) = 3.41\times 10^{16}\ N}$$</div>

    <li>On Earth, we can convert weight (measured in newtons) to mass (measured in kilograms) by dividing by 9.81 (the strength of Earth’s gravity). What is the total mass of all the CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere?</li>
    <div class="Answer">$$\mathrm{\frac{3.41\times 10^{16}\ N}{9.81\ N/kg}} = \mathrm{3.48\times 10^{14}\ kg}$$</div>
