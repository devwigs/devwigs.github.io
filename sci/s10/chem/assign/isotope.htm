<h3>Review</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Based on Rutherfordâ€™s Planetary Model of the atom:<ol type="a">
        <li>What are the three particles that make up the atom?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Protons, Neutrons, Electrons</div>

        <li>Where are the particles located in the atom?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Protons and neutrons are found in the dense, central nucleus. Electrons orbit around the nucleus like planets around the Sun.</div>

        <li>What are the relative masses and charges of the particles?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Protons and neutrons have nearly identical masses. Electrons are more than 1800 times smaller. Protons are positive and electrons are negative. Neutrons have no charge.</div>

    </ol></li>
    <li><ol type="a">
       <li>What do we mean by <b class="Red">atomic number</b>?</li> 
        <div class="Answer">Atomic number is the number of protons. This determines what element the atom is.</div>

       <li>What do we mean by <b class="Red">atomic mass</b>?</li> 
        <div class="Answer">Total number of protons and neutrons. (The electrons have an almost negligible mass.)</div>

    </ol></li>
    <li>What property of an atom determines its chemical properties?</li>
    <div class="Answer">Atomic number</div>

    <li>What do we mean by the <b class="Red">isotopes</b> of an element? As an example, describe the similarities and differences among atoms of carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Atoms with the same number of protons (atomic number) but different numbers of neutron are called isotopes. They belong to the same element by have different mass numbers.</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>What is an <b class="Red">ion</b>?</li>
        <div class="Answer">An atom where the number of electrons is different from the number of protons is called an ion.</div>

        <li>How does the net charge of an atom or ion relate to the number of each type of particles?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The net charge is the number of (positive) protons minus the number of (negative) electrons.</div>

        <li>Define <b class="Red">cation</b> and <b class="Red">anion</b> and explain how to name ions.</li>
        <div class="Answer">A cation is a positive ion and an anion is negative. Cations use the same name as the atom from which they are formed, unless the atom can form more than one ion in which case the charge is included in the name as a Roman numeral; for example, copper(II) ions. For anions, the suffix is changed to -ide; e.g. chloride instead of chlorine.</div>
    
    </ol></li>
    <li>Explain how to write and use <b class="Red">isotope notation</b>? Use the sodium-23 ion as an example.</li>
    <div class="Answer">$$_{11}^{23}\mathrm{Na}^+$$
        The atomic number is written to the lower left of the chemical symbol. The mass number is upper left. The charge (if any) is upper right.
