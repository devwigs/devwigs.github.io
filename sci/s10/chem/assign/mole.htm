    <li>How many atoms of hydrogen-1 does it take to have a total mass of 1.00 gram? What do we call this number?</li>
    <div class="Answer">1.00 g of hydrogen-1 would contain 6.02 × 10<sup>23</sup> atoms. This number is called Avogadro’s number. This quantity of atoms is called one mole.</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Why is it that the atomic molar mass of hydrogen is not exactly 1.00 g/ mol?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Some naturally occurring atoms of hydrogen are of the isotope hydrogen-2. The average molar mass for hydrogen atoms is slightly larger than 1.00 g/mol.</div>
            
        <li>Why is the molecular molar mass of hydrogen twice as large as its atomic molar mass?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Hydrogen occurs at SATP as a diatomic molecule, H<sub>2</sub>. The hydrogen molecule has a mass equal to two hydrogen atoms.</div>
