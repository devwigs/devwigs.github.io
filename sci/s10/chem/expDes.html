<section id="ind"  data-last="?"><h3>Independent Variables</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Experimental variables</em> are quantities that can (in principle) be measured as part of an experiment.</p>

<p data-mark="+"><em class="Defn">Independent variables</em> are varibles that the experimenter can specify directly, in advance of doing the experiment.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>For example, if you were doing an experiment to study a simple pendulum, you could construct the pendulum so that its
    length was 1.00 metre.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The pendulum length is an independent variable.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="dep"  data-last="?"><h3>Dependent Variables</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Dependent variables</em> are variables that cannot be specified in advance, because they <em>depend on</em> the independent ones.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>The time it takes the pendulum to complete a swing is a dependent variable, because it depends on the length of the pendulum.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Changing the length of the pendulum will affect the swing time.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">There can be multiple variables (e.g. gravity or the mass of the pendulum) that affect the time.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="hyp"  data-last="?"><h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>A <em class="Defn">hypothesis</em> is a <em>prediction</em> about how changes in one of the independent variables will
    affect one of the dependent variables.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Example: As the length of a simple pendulum is increased, the time it takes the pendulum to complete one swing will also increase.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">If possible, our prediction should include the expected mathematical relationship (i.e. an equation) between the
    variables.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The independent variable that the hypothesis refers to (e.g. length) is called the <em class="Defn">manipulated</em>
    variable.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The dependent variable in the hypothesis (e.g. time) is called the <em class="Defn">responding</em> variable.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="con"  data-last="?"><h3>Controlled Variables</h3>
<p>Independent variables that are not manipulated (for example, the pendulum’s mass) are called <em class="Defn">controlled variables</em>.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>It is very important that all controlled variables be kept constant during the experiment.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">If we were to change both the length and the mass of the pendulum, there would be no way for us to know if changes in the pendulum’s swing time
    were caused by its length or its mass. Therefore, there’s no way to decide if the hypothesis is valid or not!</li>
    <li data-mark="+">We can never be 100% certain that we’ve controlled every conceivable variable, nor is it possible to repeat an
    experiment using every possible value for every controlled variable.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">As a result, our conclusion should never claim that the experiment “proves” the hypothesis.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Scientific knowledge is always conditional (subject to change)!</li>
</ul>
