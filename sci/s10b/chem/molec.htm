        <li>Atoms prefer to have filled valence levels.</li>

    <h1>Molecular Compounds</h1>
    <p><em class="Defn">Molecular compounds</em> are compounds formed by <em>covalent bonding</em> between two or more elements to the right of the staircase.</p>

    <h1>Naming Molecular Compounds</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>For molecular compounds formed from two elements, we name the element furthest left on the periodic table first, then the second one with the suffix -ide.</li>
        <li data-slide="20">We use prefixes (mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-) to indicate how many of each type of atom are present in each molecule.</li>
        <li class="Blue" data-slide="21">\(\mathrm{P_2O_5}\) is called diphosphorous pentaoxide.</li>
        <li class="Blue" data-slide="22">\(\mathrm{H_2O}\) is called dihydrogen monoxide.</li>
        <li class="Blue" data-slide="23">\(\mathrm{CCl_4}\) is called carbon tetrachloride.</li>
        <li data-slide="24">Omit the prefix mono- on the first element.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Alternate Names</h1>
    <p>Some molecular compounds have common names that can be used as an alternative to their systematic names.</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-slide="26">Water is \(\mathrm{H_2O}\).</li>
        <li data-slide="27">Ammonia is \(\mathrm{NH_3}\).</li>
        <li data-slide="28">Propane is \(\mathrm{C_3H_8}\).</li>
        <li data-slide="29">Ethanol is \(\mathrm{C_2H_6O}\) (or \(\mathrm{C_2H_5OH}\)).</li>
        <li data-slide="30">Glucose is \(\mathrm{C_6H_{12}O_6}\).</li>
