<p><b class="Red">Faraday’s Law</b> states that a <em>changing</em> magnetic field produces an electric field. <b class="Red">Maxwell’s Law</b> proposes that the reverse is also true: a changing electric field generates a magnetic field.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The consequence of Maxwell’s Law is <b class="Red">electromagnetic radiation (EMR)</b>.</li>
    <li>Once the initial field starts to change (because of non-steady currents / accelerating charges), \(\vec{\mathbf E}\) and \(\vec{\mathbf B}\) will <em>generate each other</em> and propagate as EMR.</li>
    <li>Using some advanced math, Maxwell showed that EMR behaves as waves that travel at a speed of \(c = 3.00\times 10^8\ \mathrm{m/s}\).</li>
    <li>The wave comprises electric and magnetic fields that oscillate perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation.</li>
    <li>The <b class="Red">electromagnetic spectrum</b> includes:</li>

<p>Visible light is an EM wave because:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Light travels at the same speed predicted by Maxwell, as measured by Rømer &amp; Huygens, Fizeau, and especially <b class="Red">Michelson’s experiment</b> with an \(N\)-sided rotating mirror:
        $$c = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} = \frac{2L}{\frac{1}{N} T}$$</li>
    <li>Light travels slower through a medium than it does in vacuum depending on the medium’s <b class="Red">index of refraction</b>, \(n\):
        $$v=\frac{c}{n}$$</li>
    <li>Light exhibits an interference pattern in <b class="Red">Young’s double-slit experiment</b>.</li>
    <li>The interference pattern can be explained by Huygen’s principle, and leads to the result that the maxima (anti-nodes) and minima (nodes) are located at angles \(\theta\) from the central maximum, where:
        $$\sin\theta=\frac{n\lambda}{d}$$</li>
    <li>\(d\) is the distance between the two slits.</li>
    <li>Whole number values of \(n\) identify the maxima and half numbers (0.5, 1.5, etc.) identify the minima.</li>
    <li>We can use this result to measure the wavelength of the light observed through a diffraction grating, and to separate light into its individual wavelengths in a <b class="Red">spectroscope</b>:
        $$\lambda = \frac{d\sin\theta}{n}$$</li>
</ul>   

<p><b class="Red">Diffraction</b> is the phenomenon of waves bending or spreading out once they pass through an opening in a barrier.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each point on the opening must be treated as a source, according to Huygen’s principle.</li>
    <li>The interfrence pattern has maxima and minima described by the same equation as the double-slit experiment, except that the minima occur at the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and the maxima occur at 0, 1.5, 2.5, etc.</li>
    <li>Nearly all of the diffracted wave’s energy falls within the central maxima, as the other maxima have much smaller amplitudes.</li>
    <li>Wavelengths larger than the size of the opening diffract completely.</li>
    <li>Wavelengths much smaller than the opening hardly diffract at all.</li>
    <li>Because of its small wavelength, visible light can be treated as moving in straight lines (the <b class="Red">ray model</b>) except when passing through openings that are extremely small.</li>
    <li>Diffraction limits the ability of optical devices (microscopes, telescopes, your eye) to <b class="Red">resolve</b> two sources that are close together, as their diffraction patterns will overlap.</li>
