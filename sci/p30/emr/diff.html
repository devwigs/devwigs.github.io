<section id="dif" data-last="?"><h3>Single Opening Diffraction</h3>
<p>Scientists use the term <em class="Defn">diffraction</em> to describe the interference behaviour of waves as they pass by obstacles or through openings in a barrier.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>In the last lesson, we studied the interference pattern produced by two narrow slits.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Because the slits were narrow, we could treat them as <em>point</em> sources in applying Huygens’ Principle.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Our result was that an interference maximum would occur at any point where the path difference to the two point sources was a multiple of the wavelength:
        $$d\sin\theta = n\lambda$$</li>
</ul>

<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>A <em>single, wide</em> slit cannot be treated as only two point sources. Huygens’ Principle requires us to consider not just the two endpoints but <em>all</em> of the points in between as sources.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When point \(P\) has a path difference of one wavelength, the wavelets from the two endpoints interfere constructively; \(P\) would be on the first-order maximum if this were a two-slit experiment.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When we add up the wavelets not just from the two endpoints of the opening, but of <b>all</b> points in between as well, the interference is <em>destructuve</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The equation from the two-source interference is still applicable, but its interpretation is different.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">For a single wide opening, the interference is <em>destructive</em> when \(n\) is a natural number.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The interference is <em>contructive</em> when \(n\) is 1.5, 2.5, etc.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The interference is still <em>contructive</em> when \(n = 0\)!</li>
    <li data-mark="+">At \(n = 0.5\), there is neither a maximum nor a minimum.</li>
</ul>

<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>The maximum at \(n=1.5\) is only about 1/9th as intense as the central maximum.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The maximum at \(n=2.5\) is only about 1/25th as intense as the central maximum.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Nearly all of the wave’s energy is found within the central maximum.</li>

<section id="ex1" data-last="?"><h3>Example 1</h3>
<p class="Blue">Estimate how much the following waves “spread out” as they pass through an 80.0 cm wide door...</p>
<p class="Blue">A “treble” sound wave with \(\lambda = 20.0\ \mathrm{cm}\)</p>
<p data-mark="+">$$\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin^{-1}\mathrm{\frac{20.0\ cm}{80.0\ cm}} = 14.5^\circ$$</p>
<p data-mark="+" class="Blue">A mid-range sound wave with \(\lambda = 60.0\ \mathrm{cm}\)</p>
<p data-mark="+">$$\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin^{-1}\mathrm{\frac{60.0\ cm}{80.0\ cm}} = 48.6^\circ$$</p>
<p data-mark="+" class="Blue">A “bass” sound wave with \(\lambda = 2.00\ \mathrm{m}\)</p>
<p data-mark="+">$$\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin^{-1}\mathrm{\frac{200\ cm}{80.0\ cm}} = \mathrm{No\ Solution!}$$</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>When the wavelength is larger than the opening, there is no solution for the first minimum at \(n=1\); this means the wave diffracts completely!</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Larger wavelengths are better at diffracting than smaller wavelengths.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">This is why we can hear the bass better than the treble when music is playing in a different room.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">AM radio (longer \(\lambda\)) travels better than FM.</li>
</ul>
<p data-mark="+" class="Blue">A light wave with \(\lambda = 500\ \mathrm{nm}\)</p>
<p data-mark="+">$$\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin^{-1}\mathrm{\frac{5.00\times 10^{-7}\ m}{0.800\ m}} = (3.58\times 10^{-5})^\circ$$</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>The wavelength of visible light is so small that it essentially travels in stright lines with negligible diffraction, unless the opening is extremely narrow.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When scientists assume light moves in straight lines without diffraction, we call this the <em class="Defn">ray model</em>.</li>

<section id="res" data-last="?"><h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>When light from a point source passes through an opening (like the pupil of your eye or the lens of a telescope), diffraction causes the light to spread out.</p>
<p data-mark="=" class="Center"><img class="w32" src="img/rayleigh.png" alt="Overlap"/></p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>When two point sources are far enough apart, the light will strike your retina in such a way that you can <em class="Defn">resolve</em> two separate sources.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When the sources get too close together, the diffraction patterns will overlap and you will no longer be able to resolve the sources.</li>
</ul>
<p data-mark="+" class="Center"><img class="w16" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Airy_disk_spacing_near_Rayleigh_criterion.png" alt="Rayleigh"/></p> 
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>We can make a rough estimate of how far apart the sources must be to resolve them:
        $$\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d}$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">A more accurate equation for resolving two sources is called the <em class="Defn">Rayleigh criterion</em>.</li>

<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Astronomers prefer very large telescopes (big \(d\)) because that lets them resolve smaller angles.</li>
