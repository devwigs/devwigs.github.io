<p>When a wave reaches a boundary between two media, Huygen’s principle states that the points along the boundary should be treated as sources.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Part of the wave’s energy will be <b class="Red">reflected</b> back into the original medium, and part will be transmitted or <b class="Red">refracted</b> into the new medium.</li>
    <li>The reflected and refracted waves must have the same frequency.</li>
    <li>The wavelength and direction of the wave will change depending on the speed of the wave in the two media according to <b class="Red">Snell’s Law</b>:
        $$\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2}$$</li>
    <li>Angles of incidence and refraction are measured between the <b class="Red">normal</b> to the boundary and the direction of the wave’s propagation.</li>
    <li>When a wave passes from a slower to a faster medium, there will be a <b class="Red">critical angle</b> for \(\theta_1\) at which \(\theta_2 = 90^\circ\).</li>
    <li>When the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, <b class="Red">total internal reflection</b> occurs; the wave is completed reflected and no refracted wave exists.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because reflection and refraction both change the direction of a light ray, <b class="Red">image formation</b> can occur.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Images are formed where the reflected or refracted rays <em>appear</em> to originate from.</li>
    <li><b class="Red">Real images</b> are produced where the reflected/refracted rays converge; real images can be projected, for example onto a screen or a digital camera sensor.</li>
    <li><b class="Red">Virtual images</b>, which cannot be projected, are produced when the reflected/refracted rays diverge; we can locate the image by extending these rays backwards to locate their apparent source.</li>
    <li>Images can also be classified as enlarged/reduced and upright/inverted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Curved mirrors and lenses have a <b class="Red">focal point</b>; a point along the <b class="Red">principal axis</b> through which all <b class="Red">paraxial</b> incident rays are focussed.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Curved mirrors are usually shaped as a <em>parabaloid</em>, which produces a sharp focus.</li>
    <li>Spherical mirrors exhibit <b class="Red">spherical aberration</b>; the focus is spread out rather than at a single point.</li>
    <li><b class="Red">Chromatic aberration</b> refers to the fact that in lenses the index of refraction may depend on the frequency of the light, causing different colours to have different focal points.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><a class="Red" href="https://sci.davidmaccarthy.repl.co/applet/ray.html">Principal rays</a></b> are rays that we can draw without having to measure any angles, that allow us to find the location and properties of an image.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Draw an incident ray from the object parallel to the principal axis. The reflected/refracted ray will pass through<sup>a</sup> or away from<sup>b</sup> the focal point.</li>
    <li>Draw an incident ray from the object in line with the focus<sup>c</sup>. The reflected/refracted ray will propagate parallel to the principal axis.</li>
    <li>Draw an incident ray from the object in line with the centre of curvature<sup>d</sup> or the centre of the lens itself. The ray will reflect straight back on itself (mirrors) or propagate with no change of direction (lenses).</li>
</ol>
<p>
    <sup>a</sup> - Applies to concave mirrors and converging lenses (\(f>0\)).<br/>
    <sup>b</sup> - Applies to convex mirrors and diverging lenses (\(f<0\)).<br/>
    <sup>c</sup> - Use the secondary focus for lenses.<br/>
    <sup>d</sup> - For mirrors, the centre of curvature is at <em>double</em> the focal length.
</p>
<p>For both mirrors and lenses, we can calculate the location of the image and determine whether it is real or virtual by solving:
    $$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$</p>
<p>The <b class="Red">magnification</b> tells us whether the image is upright or inverted and enlarged or reduced:
    $$m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$</p>
