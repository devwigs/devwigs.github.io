<p>What is the nature of light?</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Sir Isaac Newton believed that light was composed of <em class="Defn">corpuscles</em> (particles).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Newton’s view was opposed by Christiaan Huygens who believed that light was a <em class="Defn">wave</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Huygens was one of the first scientists to study waves systematically. He developed what is now known as <em class="Defn">Huygens’ Principle</em>...</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Each point on a wave can be considered as a point source producing circular (for 2D) or spherical (for 3D) <em class="Defn">wavelets</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The future shape of the wave may be determined by adding up all of these wavelets.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When waves overlap to produce a larger wave (crest+crest or trough+trough) we call this <em class="Defn">constructive interference</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When waves overlap to produce a smaller wave (crest+trough) we call this <em class="Defn">destructive interference</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The simplest example of Huygens’ Principle is a wave (e.g. water waves) passing through a very narrow opening in a barrier.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The opening can be treated as a single point source: the waves should spread out in a semi-circular pattern on the other side of the barrier.</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section id="two" data-last="?"><h3>Two-Source Interference</h3>
<p>When there are <em>two</em> narrow openings in the barrier, the wavelets from one opening will overlap and interfere with the wavelets from the other opening.</p>

<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Constructive interference will occur wherever two crests (blue) or two troughs (red) overlap.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Locations of maximum constructive interference are called <em class="Defn">interference maxima</em> or <em class="Defn">anti-nodes</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Destructive interference will occur where a crest overlaps a trough.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Locations of complete destructive interference are called <em class="Defn">interference minima</em> or <em class="Defn">nodes</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The result of two-source interference will be an alternating pattern of maxima and minima.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="geo" data-last="?"><h3>Geometry of 2-Source Interference</h3>
<p>All points along the <em class="Defn">central maximum</em> are the same distance from both sources.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>These points will always experience constructive inteference.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Destructive interference will occur at points that are one-half of a wavelength closer to one source than the other, because one wave will be exactly \(\frac{1}{2}\lambda\) ahead of the other.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When the <em class="Defn">path difference</em> is exactly \(\lambda\) or an exact <em>multiple</em> (\(n\lambda\), if \(n\) is a whole number) another maximum will occur.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">We can derive an equation for the locations of the maxima and minima from the diagram below.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center" data-mark="="><img class="w12" alt="Derivation" src="img/young_deriv.png"/></p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Points \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) are the sources and \(d\) is the distance between them.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Point \(P\) is an arbitrary point.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Point \(Q\) is the same distance from \(P\) as \(S_2\), so that \(S_1Q\) is the path difference, \(n\lambda\).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When \(P\) is very far away (many times larger than \(d\)), the angle at \(P\) will be very close to zero.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When this is true, the angles \(\alpha_1\) and \(\alpha_2\) will both be very close to 90º, and the angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) will nearly equal each other.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">We can approximate the triangle \(QS_1S_2\) as a right triangle since \(\alpha_2\) is about 90º:
        $$\sin\theta = \frac{n\lambda}{d}$$</li>
</ul>

<section id="ex1" data-last="?"><h3>Example 1</h3>
<p class="Blue">Water waves with a wavelength of 2.00 metres pass through two openings separated by 5.00 metres. Find the locations of all the maxima.</p>
<p data-mark="+">$$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{n\lambda}{d}\right)$$</p>
<p data-mark="+">The <em>central maximum</em> (\(n=0\)) is always located at \(\theta = 0^\circ\).</p>
<p data-mark="+">The <em>first-order maximum</em> (\(n=1\)) will be at:
    $$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathrm{1\cdot 2.00\ m}}{\mathrm{5.00\ m}}\right) = \mathrm{23.6^\circ}$$</p>
<p data-mark="+">The <em>second-order maximum</em> (\(n=2\)) will be at:
    $$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathrm{2\cdot 2.00\ m}}{\mathrm{5.00\ m}}\right) = \mathrm{53.1^\circ}$$</p>
<p data-mark="+">There are no higher-order maxima; if we attempt to set \(n=3\), the expression in brackets will be greater than 1:
    $$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathrm{3\cdot 2.00\ m}}{\mathrm{5.00\ m}}\right) = \mathrm{No\ Solution!}$$</p>
<p data-mark="+">Because the \(\sin\) function has a maximum value of 1, there will only be solutions for:
    $$n \le \frac{d}{\lambda}$$</p>
<p data-mark="+" class="Blue">Find the locations of all the minima.</p>
<p data-mark="+">The <em>first-order minimum</em> (\(n=0.5\)) will be at:
    $$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathrm{0.5\cdot 2.00\ m}}{\mathrm{5.00\ m}}\right) = \mathrm{11.5^\circ}$$</p>
<p data-mark="+">The <em>second-order minimum</em> (\(n=1.5\)) will be at:
    $$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathrm{1.5\cdot 2.00\ m}}{\mathrm{5.00\ m}}\right) = \mathrm{36.9^\circ}$$</p>
<p data-mark="+">The <em>third-order minimum</em> (\(n=2.5\)) will be at:
    $$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathrm{2.5\cdot 2.00\ m}}{\mathrm{5.00\ m}}\right) = \mathrm{90.0^\circ}$$</p>

<section id="young" data-last="?"><h3>Young’s Experiment</h3>
<p>To settle the dispute between Newton and Huygens, Thomas Young conducted his <em class="Defn">double-slit experiment</em> in 1801.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Light will be passed through a double-slit (two narrow openings set close together).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">If light is a wave, like Huygens believed, an interference pattern of alternating bright (maxima) and dark (minima) spots should be produced.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">If light is made of particles, like Newton believed, there should be two bright spots produced corresponding to the two slits.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The results show an interfernce pattern, supporting Huygens’ belief that light is a wave.</li>
</ul>
<p data-mark="=" class="Center"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Single_slit_and_double_slit2.jpg" title="Click for source" target="Src">
    <img src="img/dbl_maxima.jpg" alt="Interference" class="w24"/>
</a></p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>The variation in brightness is due to the fact that the slits are not points (as we assumed) but rather have a finite width.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">An additional benefit of Young’s experiment was that it provided a method of separating light into different colours (wavelengths).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Furthermore, the equation can be rearranged to calculate the wavelength of light:
        $$\lambda = \frac{d\sin\theta}{n}$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">It is through measurements based on Young’s experiment that we know visible light has wavelengths ranging from just under 400 nm (violet) to around 750 nm (red).</li>
</ul>

<section id="spec" data-last="?"><h3>Spectroscopy</h3>
<p>A device that uses this phenomenon to separate and measure wavelengths is called a <em class="Defn">spectroscope</em>.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Spectroscopes typically use a <em class="Defn">diffraction grating</em> with several hundred evenly spaced slits rather than just two.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">A diffraction grating produces an interference pattern that obeys the same equation as the double-slit, but the maxima are better-defined.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">A diffraction grating is often described by the number of lines per mm; for example, 300 lines per mm means:
        $$d = \frac{1}{300}\ \mathrm{mm} = 3.33\times 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{m}$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Spectroscopy is the branch of science that deals with the analysis of light sources.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">It is used in chemistry as a method of identifying substances (since the pattern of light that each substance emits or absorbs is unique).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">It is also used in astronomy where the objects of study are often too far away to collect any data other than the EMR that they emit, absorb, or reflect.</li>
