<p><b class="Red">Momentum</b> (\(\vec{\mathbf p}\)) is the vector analog of kinetic energy:$$\vec{\mathbf p}=m\vec{\mathbf v}$$<p>
<ul>
    <li>Like \(E_k\), momentum measures “quantity of motion”, but includes a direction.</li>
    <li>Like energy, momentum is a <b class="Red">conserved</b> quantity.</li>
    <li>Unlike energy, momentum does <b>not</b> come in different forms!</li>
    <li>Momentum is measured in \(\mathrm{kg\cdot m/s}\) or \(\mathrm{N\cdot s}\).</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>change</em> in an object’s momentum is called <b class="Red">impulse</b>.<p>
<ul>
    <li>According to <b class="Red">Newton’s 2nd Law</b>, <em>forces</em> cause an object to experience a change in momentum:
        $$\Delta\vec{\mathbf p} = m\Delta\vec{\mathbf v} = \vec{\mathbf F} \Delta t$$</li>
    <li>If the force is not constant, you can calculate impulse as the area under a graph of \(\vec{\mathbf F}\) vs. \(t\).</li>
    <li>According to <b class="Red">Newton’s 3rd Law</b>, the impulse that two interacting objects exert on each other will be equal and opposite.</li>
    <li>The <em>total</em> momentum of a system will be constant, as long as there are no <em>unbalanced</em>, <em>external</em> forces.</li>
</ul>

<p>Momentum conservation is typically used to solve <b class="Red">collisions</b>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Often, a system loses mechanical energy in the form of sound or thermal energy as a result of a collision.</li>
    <li>Collisions in which there is a loss of mechanical energy are classified as <b class="Red">inelastic</b>.</li>
    <li>Collisions in which the mechanical energy remains constant are classified as <b class="Red">elastic</b>.</li>
    <li>When two colliding objects stick together, the collision will be <em>completely</em> inelastic (maximum loss of mechanical energy).</li>
</ul>

<p>Collisions involving motion in both the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions are called <b class="Red">2D collsions</b>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Draw a (tip-to-tail) <b class="Red">vector diagram</b> to add momentums; do not just add the magnitudes!</li>
    <li>The total <em>initial</em> momentum (resultant vector) must be the same as the total <em>final</em> momentum.</li>
    <li>Sometimes, you can use <b class="Red">trigonometry</b> to find missing angles or magnitudes on your vector diagram.</li>
    <li>The Pythagoras and “SOH CAH TOA” equations only apply to triangles containing a right angle.</li>
    <li>For triangles that may not contain a right angle, you can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, you can resolve each momentum vector into \(x\)- and \(y\)-<b class="Red">components</b>, and then solve the \(x\)- and \(y\)-equations independently; the total \(x\)-momentum and the total \(y\)-momentum must <em>both</em> be conserved!</li>
</ul>
