<p>Wilhelm Röntgen discovered x-rays by accident in 1895 while using a device called a <em class="Defn">cathode ray tube</em> (CRT), which creates a beam of electrons.</p>
<p class="Center"><img class="w12" alt="Rontgen" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/X-ray_by_Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen_of_Albert_von_K%C3%B6lliker%27s_hand_-_18960123-02.jpg"/></p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Röntgen noticed fluorescence from a screen when the CRT was operating, even when the CRT was completely covered!</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Röntgen concluded that the CRT produced invisible rays (which he termed <em class="Defn">x-rays</em>) that could penetrate the covering of the CRT and cause the fluorescence.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Further experiments showed that x-rays could also penetrate soft tissue and expose photographic film, allowing them to be used to take pictures of bones.</li>

<section id="x" data-last="?"><h3>Properties of X-Rays</h3>
<p>X-Rays are a form of EMR, which we know is produced by accelerating charges.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>In Röntgen’s lab, it was the electron beam colliding with the glass or the anode of the cathode ray tube that produced the EMR, due to the sudden deceleration of the electrons.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">This method of producing x-rays, by accelerating electrons to high speeds and then colliding them with a target, is called <em class="Defn">bremsstrahlung</em>, which is German for “braking radiation.”</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The spectrum for x-rays is different than for thermal EMR sources.</li>
</ul>
<p data-mark="=" class="Center"><img class="w28" alt="Spectrum" src="img/xspectrum.png"/></p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Thermal radiation comes from collisions between molecules with <em>random</em> speeds.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Bremsstrahlung x-rays are emitted by electrons that have nearly <em></em>uniform</em> (i.e. non-random) speeds.</li>
     <li data-mark="+">The highest energy photon that an electron beam can emit would have the same energy as the electron right before it collides, resulting in a <em class="Defn">cutoff</em> for the spectrum.</li>
     <li data-mark="+">This energy in turn is determined by the potential difference used to produce the electron beam:
         $$hf_{max} = \frac{hc}{\lambda_{min}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2= q\Delta V$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Note that in this equation, \(f\) and \(\lambda\) describe the x-ray photon, while \(m\), \(v\) and \(q\) are properties of the electrons.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">\(\Delta V\) is the potential difference used to accelerate the electrons.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">For example, if the beam of electrons is created using a potential difference of 2000 volts, the electrons would have a kinetic energy of 2000 electronvolts and could only emit photons with energies up to 2000 eV.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">An x-ray spectrum also includes <em class="Defn">characteristic x-rays</em>, spikes at wavelengths that are characteristic to the material being used as a target.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">These spikes represent photons produced indirectly when the electron’s kinetic energy is transferred first to an atom in the target, and the atom then emits a photon.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The energies of these photons are determined by the energy levels of the target atoms.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">In modern x-ray machines, such as you would find in a dentist’s office or hospital radiology department, the target used to produce x-rays is cooled with water or another coolant to prevent it from melting due to the energy absorbed from the electron beam.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The target may also be rotated to reduce the wear it experiences from the electron beam striking it.</li>
