<ol class="Q">
<li>
    <p>An object has a net negative charge. Three students had a disagreement about the distribution of the charge.</p>
    <p>Chris argued that the charge would be evenly distributed throughout the object (left illustration). Kelly argued that the charge would spread out over the exterior of the object only (centre illustration). Sam believed that the charge would be concentrated in the object’s centre (right illustration). Which student do you agree with? Justify your choice.</p>

<li>An object with a net positive charge is placed close to a neutral conductor as illustrated. The presence of the positive charge will cause motion of charged particles within the neutral object.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Which type of charged particle within the neutral object is likely to move? Explain.
        <div class="Soln">Answer</div></li>
    <li>As a result of this motion, part of the neutral object becomes positive and part becomes negative. The net charge remains zero. Predict the location of these positive and negative regions (known as the positive pole and the negative pole) by drawing them on a copy of the illustration above.
        <div class="Soln">Answer</div></li>
    <li>Will the force that the positive object exerts on the negative pole exactly balance the force exerted on the positive pole? Explain. If not, what will the direction of the net force be? Would your answer change if the charged object was negative instead of positive?

<li>Two identical spheres are placed in contact. One of the spheres has a net negative charge. Both spheres are good enough conductors that it is possible for charge to flow between the two spheres.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Explain what will happen in terms of movement of charges. Predict (and justify) how the net charge will be distributed between the two spheres after enough time has been allowed for the charged particles to reach their final locations.
        <div class="Soln">Answer</div></li>
    <li>Repeat for a net positive charge.

<li>Why does a neutral grain of dust become attracted to a negatively charged TV screen?

<li>A metal sphere has a net charge of –2.50 nC when it is touched to a neutral cork ball. The cork acquires a charge of –0.42 nC.
<ol type="a">
<li>Which method of charging (friction, conduction, induction) produced the charge on the cork ball?
        <div class="Soln">Answer</div></li>
<li>How much net charge does the metal sphere have after contact with the cork?
        <div class="Soln">Answer</div></li>
</ol>

<li>A metal sphere “A” has a net charge of –4.20 nC. The sphere is placed in contact with a second, identical metal sphere “B”. When the spheres are separated, sphere “A” has a charge of –2.50 nC. What was the charge on sphere “B” (i) before, and (ii) after it was placed in contact with “A”? [Hint: When two identical metal spheres are in contact, they must have the same electric charge!]
    <div class="Soln">Answer</div>
</li>

<li>Four pith (cork) balls labelled A, B, C and D have unknown charges. Use the following observations to determine whether each pith ball is positive, negative or neutral:
    <ul>
    <li>An ebonite rod charged using fur repels pith ball C and attracts the other three pith balls.</li>
    <li>There is no attraction or repulsion between B and D.</li>
    <li>Pith ball A attracts each of the other three pith balls.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="Soln">Answer</div>
</li>

<li>Three identical metal spheres initially have the following electric charges: Sphere A, +7.50 nC; Sphere B, –4.00 nC; and Sphere C, –3.50 nC. Sphere A is then placed in contact with B. These spheres are then separated, and B is placed in contact with C and then separated. What are the final charges of the three spheres?

<li>A balloon is suspended on a string near the dome of a van de Graff generator that is negatively charged. The balloon is first attracted to the dome, until it touches, at which point it begins to repel. Students adjust the height of the stand to which the balloon is attached so that the centre of the balloon is level with the centre of the dome as illustrated.
<ol type="a">
<li>Explain why the neutral balloon was initially attracted to the van de Graff dome.
        <div class="Soln">Answer</div></li>
<li>Explain why the balloon began to repel from the dome after contact was made.
        <div class="Soln">Answer</div></li>
<li>Draw a free body diagram to illustrate the directions of the gravitational, electric, and tension forces acting on the balloon.
        <div class="Soln">Answer</div></li>
<li>The balloon’s mass is 72.0 g. Calculate the gravitational force.
        <div class="Soln">Answer</div></li>
<li>Draw a vector diagram (tip-to-tail) of the three forces. Since the net force is zero (the balloon is not accelerating) the tip of the third vector should end at the same point where your diagram started (the tail of the first vector).
        <div class="Soln">Answer</div></li>
<li>Use trigonometry to calculate the electric and tension forces.
