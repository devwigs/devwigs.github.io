<p><b class="Red">Magnetism</b> is a force that acts between moving charges (i.e. currents).</p>
<ul>
<li>Charges in motion produce both electric (\(\vec{\mathbf E}\)) and magnetic (\(\vec{\mathbf B}\)) fields.</li>
<li>Charges at rest produce \(\vec{\mathbf E}\) only.</li>
<li><b class="Red">Ampere’s Law</b> states that the magnetic field strength is directly proportional to the current that produces it.</li>
<li><b class="Red">Gauss’s Law</b> states that magnetic fields form closed loops with no convergence or divergence points.</li>
<li>The direction of the magnetic field tells us the direction that the north end of a compass will point: it is not the direction of the magnetic force.</li>
</ul>

<p><b class="Red">First Hand Rule</b>: The current in a long, straight wire produces a magnetic field pattern of circular loops centred on the wire.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Point your left thumb in the direction of electron flow; your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field loops.</li>
    <li>Use your right hand instead when the source is made of positive charges.</li>
</ul>

<p><b class="Red">Second Hand Rule</b>: The current in a coil of wire produces a <b class="Red">dipolar</b> magnetic field, similar to that of a bar magnet.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Curl your left fingers in the direction of electron flow; your thumb will point to the field’s “north” pole (defined as the direction that \(\vec{\mathbf B}\) points along the loop’s axis.)</li>
    <li>Use your right hand when the source is made of positive charges.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b class="Red">Third Hand Rule</b> is used to find the <em>direction</em> of the magnetic force acting on a moving test charge or a current that is located within a magnetic field.</p>
<p class="Center"><img class="w16" src="em/img/3HR.png" alt="Magnetic Force"></p><ul>
    <li>Point your left thumb in the direction of the electron flow.</li>
    <li>Point your fingers in the direction of \(\vec{\mathbf B}\).</li>
    <li>Your palm indicates the direction of \(\vec{\mathbf F}_m\), the magnetic force.</li>
    <li>Use your right hand when the test charge/current is made of positive charges.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>magnitude</em> of the <b class="Red">magnetic force</b> acting on a moving test charge is:
    $$|\vec{\mathbf F}_m| = qvB_\perp$$
<ul>
    <li>This is the equation for the magnetic force acting on a charge \(q\) moving with speed \(v\).</li>
    <li>The direction of \(\vec{\mathbf F}_m\) is given by the third hand rule.</li>
    <li>The subscript ⊥ is an abbreviation for \(\sin\theta\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between the directions of \(\vec{\mathbf B}\) and \(\vec{\mathbf v}\).</li>
    <li>The total magnetic force acting on a current-carrying wire is:
        $$|\vec{\mathbf F}_m| = ILB_\perp$$</li>
    <li>\(I\) is the current and \(L\) is the length of wire within the magnetic field.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b class="Red">motor principle</b> is the observation that a dipole magnet (e.g. a coil or bar magnet) will try to orient itself so its north pole aligns with the external magnetic field.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <b class="Red">DC motor</b> converts electrical energy into mechanical energy; the coil will rotate until it aligns with the external field.</li>
    <li>A <b class="Red">split-ring commutator</b> and <b class="Red">brushes</b> are used to reverse the direction of the current whenever the coil reaches alignment; this keeps the motor spinning indefintely!</li>
    <li>A <b class="Red">galvanometer</b> is another application of the motor principle;
        it measures the strength of the magnetic force trying to rotate the coil, which in turn tells us how much current is flowing through the coil.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <b class="Red">generator</b> is the reverse of a motor; it uses magnetic forces to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The phenomenon of using magnetic fields to “induce” an <b class="Red">electromotive force</b> (voltage) is called <b class="Red">electromagnetic induction</b>.</li>
    <li><b class="Red">Faraday’s Law</b> states that the EMF produced in a coil is equal to the rate at which the “magnetic flux” changes. This means that an EMF will be produced whenever one of the following variables for the coil changes:
        <ul>
            <li>the area of the coil</li>
            <li>the average magnetic field experienced by the coil</li>
            <li>the orientation of the coil relative to the field</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>According to <b class="Red">Lenz’s Law</b>, when a current is induced it will experience a magnetic force in the <em>opposite</em> direction to the direction of motion.</li>
    <li>Lenz’s Law is simply the law of energy conservation applied to EM induction.</li>
    <li>Most generators consist of a coil of wire that is <em>rotated</em> through a magnetic field.</li>
    <!--li>When rotated with constant speed, the EMF varies as a sine function.</li-->
    <li>The direction of the induced current reverses every half turn of the coil: this is called <b class="Red">alternating current</b>.</li>
    <li>A split-ring commutator and brushes can be used keep the direction of the current constant; however this is often unnecessay since many electrical devices operate on AC.</li>
</ul>
