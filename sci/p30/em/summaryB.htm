Magnetism is a force that acts between moving
charges (i.e. currents).
• Charges in motion produce both electric (E) and
magnetic (B) fields; charges at rest produce E
only.
• The direction of the magnetic field tells us the
direction that the north end of a compass will
point: it is not the direction of the magnetic force.

First Hand Rule
• The current in a
long, straight
wire produces a
magnetic field
pattern of circular loops centred on the wire.
• First Hand Rule: Point your left thumb in the
direction of electron flow; your fingers will curl in
the direction of the magnetic field loops. (Use the
right hand for conventional current.)
4
Second Hand Rule
• The current in a circular loop
of wire produces a “dipolar”
magnetic field (see diagram).
• Second Hand Rule: Curl
your left fingers in the
direction of electron flow;
your thumb will point to the
field’s “north” pole (defined
as the direction that B points
along the loop’s axis.)
5
Third Hand Rule
• Third Hand Rule: Point
your left thumb in the
direction of the electron flow
and your fingers in the
direction of B; your palm
indicates the direction of Fm,
the magnetic force.
• Moving charges will experience a force (Fm) due
to the magnetic fields of other moving charges.
6
Magnetic Force
• The magnetic field is mathematically defined as
B⊥ = Fm/(qv), which can be rearranged to give:
Fm = qvB⊥.
• This is the equation for the magnetic force acting
on a charge q moving with speed v.
• The direction of Fm is given by the third hand
rule.
• The subscript ⊥ is an abbreviation for sin θ, where
θ is the angle between the directions of B and v.

Magnetic Force
• The total magnetic force of a current-carrying
wire is:
Fm = ILB⊥.
8
Motor Principle
• When a circular, current-carrying coil is placed in
a uniform magnetic field, the two sides of the coil
experience equal and opposite forces.
• These forces cause the coil to rotate so that its
north pole aligns with the external magnetic field.
9
Galvanometers
• A galvanometer consists of a coil in a magnetic
field, attached to a spring.
• The greater the current in the coil, the more
magnetic force, and the more the spring will
stretch. A galvanometer measures current.
• To make an ammeter (R ≈ 0 Ω) a galvanometer is
connected to a small resistance in parallel.
• To make an voltmeter (R ≈ ∞) a galvanometer is
connected to a large resistance in series.

DC Motors
• A DC motor converts
electrical energy into
mechanical energy.
• A current-carrying
coil placed in a
magnetic field will
start to rotate.
11
DC Motors
• The coil of a motor
has split-ring
commutators and
brushes positioned to
reverse the flow of
current every half
turn. This keeps the
coil spinning
indefinitely.


A generator is the reverse of a motor. A generator
uses magnetic forces to convert mechanical
energy into electrical energy.
• According to the 3rd Hand Rule,
when a conductor moves through a
magnetic field, some electrons will
be pushed to one end of the bar.
• The potential difference between the + and – end
of the bar (often called the electromotive force or
EMF) represents electrical energy gained.
3
Generator Principle
• Where does this electrical energy come from?
• There is current flowing as the electrons move
through the bar.
• While the current is flowing, there is
a magnetic force (according to the
3rd Hand Rule) to the left, which
causes the bar to lose some of its
kinetic energy.
• The kinetic energy is transformed into electrical
potential energy!
4
Generator Principle
• If the two ends of the bar are connected to a
circuit, electrons will flow from the negative end
through the circuit to the positive end (just like in
a battery!)
• This process of creating electric
potential energy using magnetic
forces is called electromagnetic
induction.
5
Faraday’s Law
1. The mean magnetic field (B) experienced by the
circuit.
2. The area (A) of the circuit.
3. The angle () between the circuit and the magnetic
field.
• Faraday studied the conditions under which
EM induction occurred or did not occur.
• He concluded that an EMF is produced in a
circuit whenever one or more of three
variables changes:
6
Lenz’s Law
• Faraday’s Law describes the conditions under
which an EMF will be produced.
• Lenz’s Law enables us to determine the direction
of the current that is induced.
• Since energy is conserved, a gain of electrical
energy (EMF) must be balanced by a loss of
mechanical energy.
• This requires that the magnetic force act in the
direction opposite to the motion.
• The direction of Fm determines the current
direction.

7
AC Generators
• Most generators consist of a coil of wire that is
rotated through a magnetic field.
• An EMF is produced because the angle
between B and the coil is changing.
• When rotated with constant speed, the EMF
varies as a cosine function.
• The direction of the induced current reverses
every half turn of the coil: this is called
alternating current.
8
AC Generators
• A split-ring commutator and brushes can be
used keep the direction of the current constant.
• Slip-ring commutators are used when AC is
desired.
