<p>Net <b class="Red">electric charge</b> is the difference between the number of protons and electrons in an
object.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Neutral objects can become charged by <b class="Red">friction</b>, <b class="Red">conduction</b>, or <b class="Red">induction</b>.</li>
    <li>Opposite charges attract; like charges repel.</li>
    <li>Neutral objects that can be <b class="Red">polarized</b> will attract to both positive and negative charges.</li>
</ul>

<p>Electric charge is a <b class="Red">conserved</b> quantity.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The standard SI unit of electric charge is the Coulomb (C).</li>
    <li>The charge of a single proton or electron is called the elementary charge (\(+e\) for protons and \(–e\) for electrons):
        $$1 e = 1.60\times 10^{–19}\ \mathrm{C}$$</li>
    <li>Millikan determined the elementary charge by balancing the electric and gravitational forces on an oil drop.</li>    
</ul>

<p>The force between two uniform, sphere-shaped charges, is given by <b class="Red">Coulomb’s Law</b>:
    $$|{\vec{\mathbf F}}_e| = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}$$</p>
<ul>
    <li>The value of Coulomb’s constant is determined experimentally to be
        $$k = 8.99\times 10^9\ \mathrm{\frac{N\cdot m^2}{C^2}}$$</li>
    <li>For multiple charges, the net electric force is the vector total of the electric force due to each individual field charge.</li>   
</ul>

<p>The <b class="Red">electric field</b> is defined as the ratio of the electric force to the test charge:
    $$\vec{\mathbf E} = \frac{\vec{\mathbf F}_e}{q}$$</p>
<ul>   
    <li>The electric field of a sphere-shaped source (\(Q\)) is:
        $$|\vec{\mathbf E}| = \frac{kQ}{r^2$}$</li>
    <li>The direction of \(\vec{\mathbf E}\) indicates the direction of \(\vec{\mathbf F}_e\) acting on positive test charges. For negative test charges, \(\vec{\mathbf F}_e\) is opposite to \(\vec{\mathbf E}\).</li>
</ul>

<p>On an <b class="Red">electric field diagram</b> arrows show the direction of the force on positive test charges.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Field lines point away from positive field charges and towards negative field charges.</li>
    <li>The strength of \(\vec{\mathbf E}\) is indicated by how close together the field lines are.</li>
    <li>“Crossing points” are places where the net electric field is zero.</li>
</ul>

<p>A (nearly) <b class="Red">uniform electric field</b> is produced by two parallel, oppositely charged conducting plates.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Coulomb’s formula does not apply because the charged objects are not spherical!</li>
</ul>

<p>Test charges within the electric field have <b class="Red">electric potential energy</b>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The electric field does work (transforms energy between electric potential and kinetic) when the test charges move.</li>
    <li><b class="Red">Electric potential difference</b> is defined as the ratio of the work done by the electric field, compared to the test charge:
        $$\Delta V = \frac{\Delta E}{q} = \frac{{\vec{\mathbf F}}_e\cdot\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}}{q} = \vec{\mathbf E}\cdot\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}$$</li>
    <li>The unit of potential difference is the volt: \(\mathrm{1\ V = 1\ J/C}\).</li>
    <li>Potential difference is also called voltage.</li>
    <li>For a test charge moving in a uniform field, the motion (e.g. velocity and acceleration) can be determined using uniform accelerated motion, Newton’s Laws, and/or energy conservation.</li>
</ul>
