Net electric charge is the difference between the number of protons and electrons in an
object.
Neutral objects can become charged by friction, conduction, or induction.
Opposite charges attract; like charges repel.
Neutral objects that can be polarized will attract to both positive and negative charges.

Electric Charge
Electric charge is a conserved quantity.
The standard SI unit of electric charge is the Coulomb (C).
The charge of a single proton or electron is called the elementary charge (+e for protons and –e for electrons): 1 e = 1.60×10–19 C.
Millikan determined the elementary charge by balancing the electric and gravitational forces on an oil drop.

Coulomb’s Law
The force between two uniform, sphere-shaped charges, is given by the formula:
Fe = kq1q2/r2.
The value of Coulomb’s constant is determined experimentally to be k = 8.99×109 N·m2/C2.
For multiple charges, the net electric force is the vector total of the electric force due to each individual field charge.

Electric Fields
The electric field is defined as the ratio of the electric force to the test charge: E = Fe/q.
The electric field of a sphere-shaped field charge (Q) is:
|E| = kQ/r2.
The direction of E indicates the direction of Fe acting on positive test charges. For negative test charges, Fe is opposite to E.

Electric Fields
Arrows show the direction of the force on positive test charges.
Field lines point away from positive field charges and towards negative field charges.

Electric Fields
The strength of E is indicated by how close together the field lines are.
“Crossing points” are places where the net electric field is zero.

Electric Fields
A (nearly) uniform electric field is produced by two parallel, oppositely charged conducting plates.
Coulomb’s formula does not apply because the charged objects are not spherical!

Electric Potential Energy
Test charges within the electric field have electric potential energy.
The electric field does work (transforms energy between electric potential and kinetic) when the test charges move.

Potential Difference
Electric potential difference is defined as the ratio of the work done by the electric field, compared to the test charge:
V = ΔE/q = Fe·d/q = E·d.
The unit of potential difference is the Volt: 1 V = 1 J/C.
Potential difference is also called voltage.
The particle’s speed and acceleration can be calculated from Fe and ΔE.
