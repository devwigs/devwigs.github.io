<section id="r" data-last="?"><h3>Radioactivity</h3>
<p>In 1866, Henri Becquerel discovered that compounds containing uranium exposed photographic film even though they emitted no visible light, and even when the film was kept covered. This phenomenon is called <em class="Defn">radioactivity</em>.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Marie and Pierre Curie found additional elements that exhibited this behaviour.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When the emissions from radioactive isotopes were subjected to electric or magnetic fields, scientists discovered that depending on the source, there could be positive, negative, and/or neutral particles present.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center" data-mark="="><img class="w24" alt="Radioactivity" src="img/radio.png"/></p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>The positive particles were given the name “alpha” (\(\alpha\)) after the first letter of the Greek alphabet.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Measurements of their charge-to-mass ratio and chemical properties established that \(\alpha\)-particles are fast-moving nuclei of helium-4.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The negative particles were designated as “beta” (\(\beta\)) and later identified as high-speed electrons.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The neutral particles were called “gamma” (\(\gamma\)) and later found to be extremely high-energy photons.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">All three types of particles have electromagnetic fields, and move with significant energy. This allows them to <em>ionize</em> regular matter that they interact with. (This is what causes the film to become exposed.)</li>
    <li data-mark="+">These three types of radiation are classified as <em class="Defn">ionizing radiation</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The \(\gamma\) radiation is also classified as EMR because it consists of photons.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) do not appear on the EM spectrum as they are <em>not</em> composed of photons.</li>
</ul>

<section id="prop" data-last="?"><h3>Properties &amp; Hazards</h3>
<p>Ionizing radiation has the ability to penetrate (pass through) matter.</p>

<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>As the slowest of the particles with the most charge and mass, the \(\alpha\) particles interact the most with the matter they pass through; they loses their energy the quickest.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">\(\alpha\) particles are generally unable to pass through a sheet of paper.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The \(\gamma\) particles interact the least and penetrate the most because they are the fastest and have no mass or charge.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">It takes about 7 cm of lead to absorb 99% of the photons (depending on the photon energy).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The \(\beta\) particles have medium penetrating power; they can pass through at most a few millimetres of metal.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The ionizing property of \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\gamma\) radiation makes them hazardous, as ionizing radiation can kill living cells or create mutations (random changes to DNA molecules) that can lead to cancers and birth defects.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The \(\alpha\) particles are the most dangerous ones to be exposed to, since they deposit all of their energy and do a lot of damage in a small area.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Fortunately, they are the easiest to protect yourself from due to their low penetrating ability.</li>
</ul>

<section id="det" data-last="?"><h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Detection of \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\gamma\) radiation also depends on their ionizing abilities.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li><b>Scintillation</b>: Some materials absorb energy from high energy particles and later emit the energy as visible photons (fluorescence or phosphorescence).</li>
    <li data-mark="+"><b>Photographic Film</b>: Ionizing radiation causes the same chemical reactions on film as visible light does.</li>
    <li data-mark="+"><b>Wilson Cloud Chamber</b>: A container is saturated with vapour and cooled. When radiation ionizes molecules of the vapour, condensation occurs forming “cloud” tracks along the path of the particles.</li>
    <li data-mark="+"><b>Bubble Chamber</b>: The opposite of a cloud chamber. Ionizing radiation causes bubbles of gas to form within a liquid.</li>
    <li data-mark="+"><b>Photomultiplier Tube</b>: This device detects ionizing radiation by looking for photoelectrons released when the high energy particles strike an electrode.</li>
    <li data-mark="+"><b>Geiger–Müller Tube</b>: A sealed metal cylinder and a rod mounted along its axis are maintained at a high voltage. When ionizing radiation enters the cylinder, it ionizes the gas and causes a burst of current that can be detected using a speaker or electronic counter.</li>
