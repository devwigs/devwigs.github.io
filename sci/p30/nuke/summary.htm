<div data-swipe="0">
<p>The <b class="Red">nucleus</b> of the Rutherford-Bohr atom consists of positively charged <b class="Red">protons</b> and neutral <b class="Red">neutrons</b>, both of which have masses of about \(\mathrm{1.67\times 10^{-27}\ kg}\).</p>
<ul>
    <li>The number of protons is called the <b class="Red">atomic number</b>; this determines which element a nuclide is.</li>
    <li>The total number of <b class="Red">nucleons</b> (protons + neutrons) is called the <b class="Red">mass number</b>.</li>
    <li>Most elements have more than one <b class="Red">isotope</b>; carbon always has 6 protons but can have 6, 7, or 8 neutrons.</li>
    <li>In isotope notation, the atomic number (charge) is written as a left-subscript and the mass number (nucleons) is written as a left-superscript.</li>
    <li>In a nuclear reaction, the charge and nucleons must be conserved, in addition to energy and momentum:
        $${_{6}^{14}}{\mathrm C} \rightarrow {_{7}^{14}}{\mathrm N} + {_{-1}^{0}}e + {_{0}^{0}}{\overline\nu}$$</li>
</ul>

<p>The mass of each isotope can be measured very accurately using a <b class="Red">mass spectrometer</b>, which operates on the same principles as Thomson’s CRT experiment.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A beam is produced by subjecting the ions of the sample to an accelerating voltage:
        $$qV_{acc} = W = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$</li>
    <li>If the ions do not begin from rest or do not all experiences the same potential difference, we can use a <b class="Red">velocity selector</b> (balanced electric and magnetic forces) to select only those ions with the desired speed:
        $$qvB = F_m = F_e = q|\vec{\mathbf E}|$$
        $$v = \frac{|\vec{\mathbf E}|}{B}$$
    </li>
    <li>In the <b class="Red">detector</b>, a uniform magnetic field makes the ions move in uniform circular motion:
        $$qvB = F_m = ma = m\frac{v^2}{r}$$
    </li>
</ul>

<p><b class="Red">Radioactivity</b> refers to the natural emission of <b class="Red">ionizing radiation</b> by certain isotopes.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b class="Red">Alpha particles</b> are helium-4 nuclei emitted by some large isotopes:
        $${_{92}^{238}}{\mathrm U} \rightarrow {_{90}^{234}}\mathrm{Th} + {_2^4}\mathrm{He}$$</li>
    <li>Alpha particles interact highly with matter and are very damaging, but have low pentrating power.</li>
    <li><b class="Red">Beta particles</b> are high-speed electrons emitted when a neutron turns into a proton, such as in the \(\beta-\) decay of carbon-14 shown above.</li>
    <li><b class="Red">Gamma radiation</b> are photons that carry away some of the energy released by a nuclear reaction. They have the most penetrating power as they interact the least with matter.</li>
    <li>The \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\gamma\) can be distinguished by their charge (different deflection in an electric or magnetic field) and their penetrating power.</li>
    <li>The ability to ionize matter provides several methods of detecting these particles: photographic film, photomultiplier tubes, scintillation, cloud or bubble chambers, or a Geiger-Mueller tube.</li>
</ul>

<p>Radioactive decay is random; it follows an exponential probability distribution with a half-life that is characteristic of each isotope:
    $$N = N_0\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n$$
    $$n = \frac{t}{T_{1/2}}$$
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b class="Red">Half-life</b> is defined as the time over which the probability of any individual nucleus decaying is 50%. For a large sample size, the amount remaining after one half-life will be very close to one-half of the initial amount.</li>
    <li>\(N\) is any measure of the amount of the radioactive isotope present, such as the number or mass of these atoms, the percentage remaining, or the activity (measured in becquerels, Bq).</li>
    <li>From a graph of \(N\) vs. \(t\), find the point on the graph where the quantity remaining is half the original amount; this allows you to read the half-life from the \(t\)-axis.</li>
    <li><b class="Red">Radiocarbon dating</b> is used to determine the age of dead material (wood, bone, leather, etc.) based on how much radioactive carbon-14 remains.</li>
</ul>

<p>Einstein proposed the idea of <b class="Red">mass-energy equivalence</b>:$$E=mc^2$$</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mass is a form of energy that can be converted to (or from) other energy forms.</li>
    <li>The energy released in a nuclear reaction is large enough that there is a measurable change in the mass!</li>
    <li>By comparing the mass of the products to the reactants, we can calculate the energy released by a reaction.</li>
    <li>The <b class="Red">mass defect</b> is the difference between the mass of a nuclide and its individual nucleons:
        $${_{92}^{235}}{\mathrm U} \rightarrow 92\left({_1^1}{\mathrm H}\right) + 143\left({_0^1}n\right)$$</li>
    <li>Multiplying the mass defect by \(c^2\) gives the <b class="Red">nuclear binding energy</b>,  the energy needed to disassmble the nucleus.</li>
    <li>A larger NBE <em>per nucleon</em> indicates a more stable isotope.</li>
    <li>Iron-56 is the most stable isotope based on the greatest NBE per nucleon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nuclei larger than iron-56 tend to undergo <b class="Red">nuclear fission</b>, reactions where a nucleus breaks into two or more smaller nuclei.</p>
<ul>
    <li>With some isotopes, fission can be induced by <b class="Red">neutron bombardment</b>:
        $${_{92}^{235}}{\mathrm U} + {_0^1}n \rightarrow {_{92}^{236}}{\mathrm U} \rightarrow {_{56}^{141}}{\mathrm {Ba}} + {_{36}^{92}}{\mathrm {Kr}} + 3\left({_0^1}n\right)$$</li>
    <li>If the nuclear fuel exceeds <b class="Red">critical mass</b>, each neutron absorbed has a likelihood of emitting more than one additional neutron that will itself be absorbed. This results in a <b class="Red">chain reaction</b>.</li>
    <li>We can reduce the critical mass by <b class="Red">enriching</b> the fuel to have a higher proportion of fissile nuclei.</li>
    <li>We can also enhance the reaction by <b class="Red">moderating</b> the neutrons (for example by allowing them to collide with deuterium nuclei) so they have the optimal speed for creating a chain reaction.</li>
    <li><b class="Red">Control rods</b> made of a material that absorbs neutrons can be used to control the rate of reaction.</li>
    <li>Pressurized heavy water can be used as both a moderator and as a coolant to collect energy from the reactor as heat.</li>
    <li>The heat can be used to generate steam that turns a turbine connected to an electrical generator.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nuclei smaller than iron-56 tend to undergo <b class="Red">nuclear fusion</b>, joining together to form larger nuclei.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Because both reacting nuclei are positively charged, it is very difficult to overcome the long-range electric repulsion to move the nuclei close enough for the short-range <b class="Red">strong nuclear force</b> to kick in and allow the fusion to occur.</li>
    <li>Fusion requires extremely high temperatures and pressures such as found in the core of the Sun and other stars.</li>
</ul>

<p>Protons and neutrons are <b>not</b> fundamental particles. According to the <b class="Red">standard model</b> of particle physics, each is composed of three smaller particles called <b class="Red">quarks</b>.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Quarks are fundamental <b class="Red">fermions</b> that experience the strong nuclear force.</li>
    <li>A proton consists of two “up” quarks and one “down” quark.</li>
    <li>A neutron consists of one “up” quark and two “down” quarks.</li>
    <li>Fundamental fermions that do not experience the strong nuclear force (electrons and neutrinos) are called <b class="Red">leptons</b>.</li>
    <li>Neutrinos have extremely small masses, are very penetrating, and interact minimally with matter (they are non-ionizing).</li>
    <li>There are second and third generation quarks and leptons which have higher energies than the first generation ones.</li>
    <li>Fermions obey the <b class="Red">Pauli Exclusion Principle</b>: each fermion must have a unique quantum state. This is why you cannot put an unlimitted number of electrons in an atom’s lowest energy level.</li>
    <li>Particles that do not follow the Exclusion Principle are called <b class="Red">bosons</b>.</li>
    <li>Several fundamental bosons are responsible for all (except maybe gravity?) interactions (forces) that occur in nature...
        <ul>
            <li>Photons are responsible for electromagnetic forces.</li>
            <li>Gluons are responsible for the strong nuclear force.</li>
            <li>The \(Z\) and \(W^\pm\) bosons are responsible for the weak nuclear force which causes \(\beta-\) and \(\beta+\) decays.</li>
            <li>Gravitons (hypothesized but not yet observed) may be responsible for gravitational forces.</li>
            <li>The Higgs boson is responsible for all other particles having mass.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>For each of the twelve fundamental fermions, there is a corresponding <b class="Red">anti-particle</b>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The electron’s anti-particle is called the <b class="Red">positron</b>.</li>
    <li>Positrons have the same mass but opposite sign charge as a normal electron.</li>
    <li>Positrons are emitted in \(\beta+\) decay where a proton turns into a neutron.</li>
    <li>Positrons and electrons can undergo <b class="Red">pair annihilation</b> where all of their mass-energy is transformed into photons:
        $${_{-1}^0}{e} + {_{1}^0}{\overline{e}} \rightarrow 2\left({_0^0}\gamma\right)$$</li>
    <li>If the electron/positron momenta are much smaller than the momentum of each photon, the photons must have the same wavelength and opposite directions so that their combined momentum is close to zero.</li>
