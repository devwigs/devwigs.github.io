<p>Based on NBE per nucleon the most stable isotope is iron-56.</p>

<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Isotopes larger than Fe-56 tend to undergo reactions (such as \(\alpha\) decay) which produce smaller nuclei. Such reactions are called <em class="Defn">nuclear fission</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Some isotopes (such as uranium-235 and plutonium-239) will undergo fission reactions when bombarded with neutrons:
        $${_{92}^{235}}{\mathrm U} + {_0^1}n \rightarrow {_{92}^{236}}{\mathrm U} \rightarrow {_{56}^{141}}{\mathrm {Ba}} + {_{36}^{92}}{\mathrm {Kr}} + 3\left({_0^1}n\right)$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">There are many different products that might be produced from these same reactants.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Unlike natural \(\alpha\) decay which proceeds at a fixed rate determined by the half-life, the rate of neutron-induced fission reactions can be changed by altering the concentrations of neutrons and the fissile material and the neutron energy.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The reaction is most effective when the reacting neutrons have “moderate” energies: not so fast that they bounce off the nucleus without reacting, and not so slow that they have insufficient energy to initiate the reaction.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The neutrons that are produced by the reaction can react with other fissile nuclei, producing even more neutrons, and setting off a <em class="Defn">chain reaction</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">If the size and concentration of the fissile material is large enough to produce a self-sustaining chain reaction, we say the fuel has exceeded <em class="Defn">critical mass</em>.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="mod" data-last="?"><h3>Enrichment, Moderators, and Control Rods</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Natural uranium is mostly U-238 and contains only 0.7% of the fissile isotope U-235.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The process of artificially increasing the relative amount of U-235 to make it a more efficient fuel is called <em class="Defn">enrichment</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The more enriched the fuel is, the lower the critical mass will be.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The neutrons emitted by the reaction may be moving too fast to be effective in producing a chain reaction. The neutrons may slow down eventually due to collisions; however the uranium nuclei are not very effective at slowing the neutrons because they are so much larger.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The fast neutrons can be slowed (or “moderated”) more quickly by introducing a smaller isotope into the reaction chamber.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Deuterium (hydrogen-2) is an excellent <em class="Defn">moderator</em> because it is very small, but does not absorb the neutrons as readily as H-1 does.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">In a nuclear reactor, it is very important to be able to slow the chain reaction to prevent the reactor from becoming so hot that the reactor itself begins to melt (“meltdown”).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">This is done by introducing <em class="Defn">control rods</em> made from a material that will absorb neutrons, reducing the number of fissions events.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Cadmium is an excellent choice for these control rods because Cd-110, Cd-111, Cd-112, Cd-113 and Cd-114 are all stable!</li>

<section id="candu" data-last="?"><h3>CANDU Reactor</h3>
<p>The CANDU (CANadian Deuterium Uranium) reactor designed by Atomic Energy of Canada is used for electricity generation in Canada and internationally.</p>
<p class="Center"><a target="Wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CANDU_Reactor_Schematic.svg">
<img class="w20" alt="CANDU" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/CANDU_Reactor_Schematic.svg"/>
</a></p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li> The CANDU reactor uses uranium (either natural or enriched) as a fuel, and uses “heavy water” (i.e. \(\mathrm{H_2O}\) in which the hydrogen atoms are the heavier isotope H-2) as both a moderator and a coolant.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The heavy water in the reactor is pressurized, allowing it to be heated well above the normal boiling point of water.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">This superheated heavy water is pumped from the reactor into a heat exchanger where it is used to heat normal water into steam.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The steam pressure spins a turbine that is connected to a generator that produces electricity.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">One of the hazards of nuclear fission reactors (in addition to the risk of a meltdown!) is that the reactions produce isotopes that are radioactive (e.g. Ba-141 and Kr-92 in the example).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Also, some of the deuterium in the heavy water is converted to radioactive tritium (hydrogen-3).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Radioactive waste must be kept out of the environment until it is no longer radioactive.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Another issue is heat pollution. After turning the turbine, the steam is cooled back into liquid water and the warm water is released into a nearby body of water.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Note that the water released into the environment has never been in the reactor core and is therefore not radioactive.</li>

<section id="fus" data-last="?"><h3>Nuclear Fusion</h3>
<p>For isotopes smaller than iron-56, energy can often be released by <em class="Defn">nuclear fusion</em>: a reaction in which two or more smaller nuclides are joined together to produce a larger one:
    $${_1^2}{\mathrm{H}} + {_1^3}{\mathrm{H}} \rightarrow {_2^4}{\mathrm{He}} + {_0^1}n$$</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Fusion reactions typically release more energy than fission reactions, as shown by the graph of NBE per nucleon.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The main difficulty with fusion reactions is that the reactants are both positively charged nuclei. This means the nuclei will repel each other (due to the electric force) making it difficult to bring them close enough to “fuse” together.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The attractive force that keeps the protons and neutrons bound together within the nucleus is known as the <em class="Defn">strong nuclear force</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">This force is extremely short range: it only acts over distances of about \(\mathrm{10^{–14}\ m}\) and smaller.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">In contrast, the electric force is a long-range force.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Fusion reactions will occur spontaneously only under extreme pressures and temperatures where the nuclei are moving fast enough to overcome the electric repulsion.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Such conditions occur in the core (centre) of the Sun and other stars where helium is produced from hydrogen through a series of reactions such as the example above.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="star" data-last="?"><h3>Fusion in Stars</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In many stars, the temperature may eventually become hot enough that the helium may fuse to produce larger nuclei.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The bigger the star, the larger the nuclei that may eventually be produced by fusion.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Once the star begins to produce iron and similarly sized isotopes, production of even larger isotopes will not occur except in very small quantities.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">This is because such reactions result in a loss of energy, causing the temperature to fall, and thereby shutting the reaction off!</li>
    <li data-mark="+">If the iron core of a very massive star grows too large, the star will not be able to support its own weight.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The result will be a huge explosion called a <em class="Defn">supernova</em> that expels the outer layers of the star into space.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The iron core that is left behind will be compressed to extreme densities.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The particles will be so close together that electrons and protons will start to collide to produce neutrons:
        $${_1^1}p + {_{-1}^0}e\rightarrow {_0^1}n + {_0^0}\nu$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The resulting super-dense object is known as a <em class="Defn">neutron star</em>.</li>
