<section id="mc2" data-last="?"><h3>Mass &amp; Energy</h3>
<p>Albert Einstein proposed the idea of <em class="Defn">mass-energy equivalence</em>.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>According to Einstein, mass is a form of energy that can be transformed to or from other types of energy:
        $$E = m c^2$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">In chemical reactions, the energy released (or absorbed) in a reaction is typically on the order of \(\mathrm{10^5\ J/mol}\).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">This corresponds to a change in mass of about \(\mathrm{10^{–12}\ kg/mol}\) which is too small to notice. In chemical reactions, mass can be considered as a conserved quantity.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">For nuclear reactions, the energy change is typically around \(\mathrm{10^{11}\ J/mol}\), resulting in a noticeable mass change of \(\mathrm{10^{–6}\ kg/mol}\).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">As we’ve already seen, energy released may take the form of kinetic energy (e.g. of the \(\alpha\), \(\beta-\), and \(\beta+\) particles), photons, or neutrinos.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Note that “heat” and “sound” cannot be produced directly, since these forms of energy involve the motion of molecules; nuclei exist on a much smaller distance scale than do molecules.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Since the mass of isotopes can be measured extremely accurately using a mass spectrometer, we can calculate the energy change in any nuclear reaction by comparing the masses of the products to the reactant(s).</li>
</ul>

<section id="nbe" data-last="?"><h3>Mass Defect &amp; Nuclear Binding Energy</h3>
<p>Mass-energy calculations can be used to estimate the <em>stability</em> of various isotopes, using the rule-of-thumb that lower energy configurations tend to be more stable.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li><em class="Defn">Mass defect</em> is the difference between the actual mass of an isotope and the combined mass of the individual particles that comprise it.</li>
    <li data-mark="+"><em class="Defn">Nuclear binding energy</em> (NBE) is the energy equivalence of the mass defect using:
        $$\Delta E = \Delta\cdot m c^2$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">NBE represents the amount of energy needed to break the nucleus apart into individual nucleons; for example...
        $${_2^4}{\mathrm {He}} \rightarrow 2\left({_1^1}{\mathrm H}\right) + 2\left({_0^1}n\right)$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The relative stability of different isotopes can be estimated by comparing the nuclear binding energies <em>per nucleon</em>; i.e. the NBE divided by the mass number.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Energies of nuclear reaction are often expressed in <em>megaelectronvolts</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">\(\mathrm{MeV/c^2}\) is sometimes used as a unit of mass; it is defined as the mass equivalent of \(\mathrm{1\ MeV}\) of energy.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Another unit of mass is the <em class="Defn">atomic mass unit</em> (u or amu), which is defined such that carbon-12 has a mass of <em>exactly</em> 12 u.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The atomic mass unit is equal to \(\mathrm{1.6605 \times 10^{–27}\ kg}\), a fraction of a percent smaller than the proton or neutron mass.</li>
</ul>
