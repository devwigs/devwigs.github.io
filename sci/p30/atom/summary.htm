<p><b class="Red">Dalton’s Billiard Ball Model</b> proposes that atoms are featureless spheres.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Different elements have atoms of different sizes.</li>
    <li>This model explains the <b class="Red">Law of Definite Proportions</b> and is the basis of <b class="Red">Kinertic-Molecular Theory</b> (which explains phenomena such as temperature and the ideal gas law).</li>
</ul>

<p><b class="Red">Thomson’s CRT Experiment</b> studied how uniform electric and magnetic fields affected a beam of particles in a cathode ray tube.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The particles are accelerated into a beam by an <em>accelerating potential</em>:
        $$q\Delta V_{acc} = W = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$</li>
    <li>A <em>deflecting potential</em> creates an electric field that deflects the particles perpendicular to their direction of motion.</li>
    <li>A magnetic field creates a force in the opposite direction to the electric force.</li>
    <li>When the fields are adjusted so the forces balance:
        $$q|\vec{\mathbf E}| = F_e = F_m = qvB$$</li>
    <li>This allows the speed of the particles to be calculated.</li>
    <li>Turning off the deflecting electric field results in uniform circular motion through the magnetic field:
        $$F_m = ma$$
        $$qvB = m\frac{v^2}{r}$$
        $$\frac{q}{m} = \frac{v}{Br}$$
    </li>
</ul>
<p>When Thomson’s CRT experiment is performed on both negative and positive charges:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The negative particles (<b class="Red">electrons</b>) have much smaller masses than the positive charges.</li>
    <li>Electrons are identical in all elements.</li>
    <li>The positive parts are <em>not</em> identical in different elements.</li>
</ul>

<p><b class="Red">Thomson’s Raisin Bun Model</b> proposes that atoms are like a positively-charged bun with electrons embedded in it like raisins.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Atoms of different elements have different sizes as in Dalton’s model.</li>
    <li>Larger elements have more electrons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rutherford, Geiger, and Marsden <b class="Red">scattered alpha particles</b> (helium-4 nuclei produced by radioactive decay) from a thin foil of gold or aluminum.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most alpha particles passed through undeflected, as expected.</li>
    <li>A small fraction of the particles scattered to large angles, which could not be explained by the Raisin Bun model.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rutherford proposed the <b class="Red">Planetary (Nuclear) Model</b> to replace the Raisin Bun.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A small but massive nucleus contains the atom’s positive charge and almost all of its mass.</li>
    <li>Electrons orbit around the nucleus like planets around the Sun.</li>
    <li>Most of the alpha particles were undeflected because they encountered only empty space.</li>
    <li>Large deflections occur for the small fraction of alpha particles that collide head-on (or close to head-on) with the nucleus.</li>
    <li>Analysis of the results shows that the diameter of the nucleus is \(10^4\) or \(10^5\) times smaller than the diameter of the atom.</li>
    <li>Rutherford’s model does not explain why the orbiting electrons do not continuously emit EMR.</li>
</ul>

<p>Niels Bohr modified the Planetary Model by adding the idea of <b class="Red">energy levels</b>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assuming that the <b class="Red">angular momentum</b> of the orbiting electrons was quantized, Bohr showed that electrons could only orbit in certain orbits with specific energies.</li>
    <li>Electrons would only emit (or absorb) photons when they jumped from one energy level to another</li>
    <li>Atoms can only emit certain (discrete) wavelengths that have photon energies corresponding to the <em>difference</em> between electron energy levels.</li>
    <li>The calculated energy levels correctly predict the emission spectrum for hydrogen.</li>
    <li>Atoms with more than one electron are more complicated due to the repulsion between electrons.</li>
</ul>

<p>De Broglie hypothesized that <b class="Red">wave-particle duality</b> applies to electrons and other particles, which have a <b class="Red">de Broglie wavelength</b>:
    $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$</p>
<ul>
    <li>If we treat the orbiting electron in the atom as a wave, a <b class="Red">stationary state</b> (that would not emit EMR) can only occur when the circumference of the orbit is an exact multiple of the de Broglie wavelength:
        $$2\pi r = n\left(\frac{h}{p}\right)$$</li>
    <li>This explains why the angular momentum is quantized!
        $$rp = n\left(\frac{h}{2\pi}\right)$$</li>
</ul>
<p>Direct evidence that electrons can behave as waves comes from interference patterns that occur with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Diffraction of electrons from a crystal, as observed by Davisson and Germer;</li>
    <li>Double-slit experiments, similar to Young’s experiments with light.</li>
</ul>
