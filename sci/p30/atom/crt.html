<section id="crt" data-last="?"><h3>Cathode Ray Tube</h3>
<p>A cathode ray tube is a device that uses a strong electric field to produce a beam of electrons.<p>
<p class="Center"><img class="w28" alt="CRT" src="img/crt.png"/></p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Although the electrons themselves are not visible, coating the tube with a fluorescent material or filling the tube with certain low pressure gases will cause a glow to appear that lets us “see” the electron beam.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The nature of the beam was unknown when scientists started using CRTs in the late 19th century.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Experimentation showed that the beam originated at the cathode (negative electrode), resulting in the name cathode ray.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">By applying electric and magnetic fields, scientists determined that the cathode ray particles were negatively charged.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="v" data-last="?"><h3>Speed of CRT Particles</h3>
<p>J.J. Thomson conducted an experiment in 1897 that enabled him to determine the speed of the cathode ray particles, and the <em>ratio</em> of the particles’ charge to mass.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Thomson placed a second pair of electrodes in the CRT to produce an electric field perpendicular to the beam’s direction.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The effect of this field was to deflect the beam toward the positive electrode.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Thomson then applied a uniform magnetic field to the same region of the CRT to produce a magnetic force in the <em>opposite direction</em> to the electric force.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Thomson next adjusted the relative strengths of the two fields until the forces balanced, causing the beam to remain undeflected:
        $$F_e = F_m$$
        $$q|\vec{\mathbf E}_{def}| = qvB$$
        $$v = \frac{|\vec{\mathbf E}_{def}|}{B}$$
    </li>
    <li data-mark="+">Thomson determined the speed of the particles by dividing the field strengths.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The subscript “def” distinguishes the <em>deflecting</em> electric field from the <em>accelerating</em> electric field. Both fields can be calculated using the respective voltages and distances between electrodes:
        $$|\vec{\mathbf E}| = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d}$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Millikan had not yet performed his oil drop experiment, so the charge of the particles was unknown.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="qm" data-last="?"><h3>Charge-to-Mass Ratio</h3>
<p>Once the particle speed was known, Thomson turned off one of the fields and left the other on.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Since the forces are no longer balanced, the CRT particles have an acceleration.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center" data-mark="="><img class="w20" alt="CRT" src="img/crt2.jpg"/></p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>A uniform magnetic field causes uniform circular motion:
        $$F_m = ma_c$$
        $$qvB = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
        $$\frac{q}{m} = \frac{v}{Br}$$
    </li>
    <li data-mark="+">By measuring the radius of the particles’ trajectory in a uniform magnetic field, Thomson could determine the ratio of the charge to mass.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Thomson found that the \(q/m\) ratio was the same no matter which material was used for the cathode; all electrons are the same!</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Millikan had not yet performed his oil drop experiment, so the charge of the particles was unknown.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Once Millikan’s experiment was complete, the results of the two experiments could be combined to find the mass of the electron.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Thomson then reversed the direction of the accelerating field and introduced positive ions, to create a beam of positive particles.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The results showed that positive ions have a much smaller \(q/m\) ratio (i.e. a much larger mass) than the negative particles.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The \(q/m\) ratio is different for different ions.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="E" data-last="?"><h3>Projectile Motion</h3>
<p>Alternatively, the second part of the experiment can be done with a uniform electric field instead of a magnetic field.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>A uniform electric field causes projectile (parabolic) motion instead of uniform circular motion.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The electric field acts in the \(y\)-direction and causes the acceleration:
        $$\vec{\mathbf a}_y = \frac{\vec{\mathbf F}_e}{m} = \frac{q\vec{\mathbf E}_{def}}{m}$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The \(y\)-velocity is then:
        $$\vec{\mathbf v}_y = \vec{\mathbf v}_{iy} + \vec{\mathbf a}_y \Delta t = \frac{q\vec{\mathbf E}_{def}}{m} \Delta t$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Because there is no force in the \(x\)-direction, the \(x\)-motion is uniform:
        $$\vec{\mathbf v}_x = \frac{\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}_x}{\Delta t}$$</li>
    <li data-mark="+">If we multiply the magnitudes of the two equations the time will cancel:
        $$v_y v_x = \frac{q}{m} |\vec{\mathbf E}_{def}| \Delta d_x$$
        $$\frac{q}{m} = \frac{v_y v_x}{|\vec{\mathbf E}_{def}| \Delta d_x}$$
    </li>
    <li data-mark="+">We can calculate the \(q/m\) ratio using the initial speed of the particles as \(v_x\) and using trigonometry to calculate \(v_y = v_x\tan\theta\).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Thus Thomson needed to measure the direction of the beam’s motion (\(\theta\)) after travelling a known horizontal distance \(\Delta d_x\).</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The results of the experiment when performed in a uniform electric field are the same as when performed in a uniform magnetic field.</li>
</ul>
