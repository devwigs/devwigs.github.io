    <h1>Position</h1>
    <p>A first step in describing an object’s motion is being able to describe where the object is: this is called the object’s <em class="Defn">position</em>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The object’s position is represented by its distance from the origin, with the positions on one side of the origin assigned positive values and the other side of the origin assigned negative values.</li>
        <li data-slide="2">A measurement that describes a position is called a <em class="Defn">coordinate</em>.</li>
        <li data-slide="3">The <em class="Defn">origin</em> is an arbitrarily chosen point which is assigned a coordinate of exactly 0.</li>
        <li data-slide="4">The symbol for position is \({\vec{\mathbf d}}\) and the SI unit is metres (m).</li>
        <li data-slide="5">The bike’s initial position in the above illustration is \({\vec{\mathbf d}}_i = {\mathrm{-5.0\ m}}\) and its final position is \({\vec{\mathbf d}}_f = {\mathrm{+7.0\ m}}\).</li>
        <li data-slide="6">The illustration uses the tree as the origin: the bike is initially 5.0 metres to the left of the tree, and after some time it has moved to 7.0 metres to the right of the tree.</li>
        <li data-slide="7">When an object moves only in a straight line (either forward or backward), we call this <em class="Defn">one-dimensional (1D) motion</em>, because we only need to make one measurement to describe the position.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-slide="8">We can describe the motion of the bike with a data table.</p>

<h1>Displacement</h1>
<p>The change in an object’s position between any two points on its trajectory is called the <em class="Defn">displacement</em>.</p>
<ul data-slide="11">
	<li><em class="Defn">Trajectory</em> means the path that the object follows.</li>
	<li data-slide="12">The symbol for displacement is \(\Delta{\vec{\mathbf d}}\):$$\Delta{\vec{\mathbf d}}_{1\rightarrow 2} = {\vec{\mathbf d}}_2 - {\vec{\mathbf d}}_1$$</li>
    <li data-slide="13">The bicycle’s displacement for the entire 4.0-second time interval is:$$\Delta{\vec{\mathbf d}} = {\mathrm{(+7.0\ m) − (−5.0\ m) = +12.0\ m}}$$</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="14">Displacment is represented on the diagram by the red arrow connecting the intial and final positions.</p>
<ul data-slide="15">
	<li>The displacement of +12.0 m means that the red arrow is 12.0 metres long and points in the positive direction.</li>
	<li data-slide="16">Displacement is classified as a <em class="Defn">vector</em> quantity because it involves a direction.</li>
	<li data-slide="17">Quantities that do not involve a direction (like mass, time, or energy) are classified as <em class="Defn">scalars</em>.</li>
	<li data-slide="18">The length of the arrow (without direction) is called the <em class="Defn">magnitude</em> of the vector.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Vector Diagrams</h1>
<p>When the motion contains more than a single displacement, the vector diagram consists of all displacements drawn in a “tip-to-tail” manner.</p>
<p class="Center"><img src="kin1d/img/field-1.png" onclick="nextImage(this, event, 2)" alt="Soccer" class="Zoom" width="480"/></p>
<ul data-slide="20">
	<li>The <em class="Defn">resultant</em> (total) displacement is drawn from the starting position of the first vector to the final position of the last vector.</li>
	<li data-slide="21">Displacement is always measured in a straight line, even if the object’s trajectory is not straight.</li>
    <li data-slide="22">This means the magnitude of the displacement will be less than the distance travelled by the object whenever the object follows an indirect path.</li>
    <li data-slide="23">If the bike (in the 1D example above) rode <em>past</em> the 7.0 metre mark, and then turned around and came back, its displacement would still be +12.0 m but its distance travelled would be greater.</li>
