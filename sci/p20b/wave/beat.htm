<p>When two or more waves overlap in the same place and time, they combine to produce a new wave. We call this phenomenon <em class="Defn">interference</em>.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>You can hear interference of radio waves when you are between two cities that have radio stations broadcasting on the same (or close) frequencies; your receiver picks up both overlapping broadcasts.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">You can also observe interference in a pool, where waves (ripples) from multiple sources overlap to produce a complicated pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="next">The <em class="Defn">Principle of Superposition</em> states that the combined wave is a simple sum of the interfering waves.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>For example, if a compression of one sound wave has a pressure 1.0 pascal higher than atmospheric pressure, and a compression of a second sound wave is 2.0 Pa above atmospheric, then at the instant the two compressions overlap, the pressure will be 3.0 Pa above atmospheric pressure.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Interference is called <em class="Defn">constructive</em> whenever and wherever two positive parts (e.g. two crests or compressions) or two negative parts (e.g. two troughs or rarefactions) overlap to produce a bigger wave.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Interference is <em class="Defn">destructive</em> when one positive and one negative part (e.g. a crest and a trough or a compression and a rarefaction) overlap to produce a smaller wave.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Interfering waves can produces constructive interference at some places and times while also producing destructive interference in other places and times.</li>

<p>One application of interference is in the production of <em class="Defn">beats</em>.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>When two sound waves (or any other type of wave) with slightly different frequencies interfere, they will gradually move in and out of sync due to the slight difference in frequency.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">As a result, the interference will alternate between being constructive and destructive.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Caption" data-slide="next">Beat Pattern</p>
<p class="Center" data-slide="same">A 9 Hz wave (top) and an 8 Hz wave (centre) interfere to produce 1 beat per second (bottom).</p>

<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>The frequency of the beats is equal to the <em>difference</em> between the individual wave frequencies:
        $$f_{beat}=\left|f_1-f_2\right|$$</li>
