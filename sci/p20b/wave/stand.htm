<h3>Reflection of Waves</h3>
<p>When a wave reaches the end of the medium, its energy is <em class="Defn">reflected</em> back the way it came.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>The reflected waves and the <em class="Defn">incident</em> (incoming) waves will <em>interfere</em> with each other.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">When the reflection occurs from a <em>fixed</em> end (e.g. a guitar string), the reflection will be <em>inverted</em>; crests will be reflected as troughs and vice versa.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Reflections from a <em>free</em> end will not be inverted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nodes &amp; Anti-nodes</h3>
<p>At a fixed end, <em>destructive</em> interference will occur.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>The incident crest and the reflected trough will cancel each other out.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">A point where the interfering waves cancel is called a <em class="Defn">node</em>.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The amplitude will be exactly zero at a node due to the destructive interference.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">For a string fixed at both ends, like a guitar string, both ends must be nodes.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">A place where the incident and reflected waves interfering constructively is called an <em class="Defn">anti-node</em>.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Anti-nodes will have a large amplitude.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Standing Waves</h3>
<p>Because both ends are nodes, the longest possible wavelength harmonic wave that can be produced on a string with fixed ends will look like this:</p>
<p class="Caption">Fundamental Standing Wave (\(n = 1\))</p>
<p class="Center"><img class="Zoom" width="640" src="wave/img/stand1.png" alt="First"/></p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>Waves like this are called <em class="Defn">standing waves</em> because the incident and reflected waves are carrying energy in opposite directions, so that there is no net movement of energy.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">We can see from the illustration above that the length of the string is equal to one-half of a wavelength:$$L = {\lambda\over 2}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">This standing wave, with nodes at the ends and nowhere else, is called the <em class="Defn">fundamental</em>, or <em class="Defn">first harmonic</em>.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Standing waves with higher frequencies than the fundamental are called overtones.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">We can produce these higher harmonics by adding more nodes along the string.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The second harmonic has a node at the middle as well as the ends.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Caption" data-slide="same">Second Harmonic (\(n = 2\))</p>
<p class="Center" data-slide="same"><img class="Zoom" width="640" src="wave/img/stand2.png" alt="Second"/></p>
<p class="Caption" data-slide="next">Third Harmonic (\(n = 3\))</p>
<p class="Center" data-slide="same"><img class="Zoom" width="640" src="wave/img/stand3.png" alt="Third"/></p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>We can continue adding more nodes by increasing the frequency to produce higher harmonics.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The harmonic number (\(n\)) indicates the number of crests and troughs present in the standing wave.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Since each crest or trough is one-half of a wavelength, we can write an equation relating the wavelength to the harmonic number and the length of the string: $$L=n\left(\frac{\lambda}{2}\right)$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Solving for \(\lambda\) and substituting into \(v=\lambda f\) gives: $$\lambda=\frac{2L}{n}$$
        $$f_n=\frac{nv}{2L}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">This equation tells us that the frequency of the \(n\)’th harmonic is \(n\) times the fundamental frequency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Air Columns</h3>
<p>Sound waves inside a simple <em class="Defn">air column</em> (open at both ends) form standing waves in the same way that waves on a string do.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>The open ends are “fixed” at atmospheric pressure by virtue of being open.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The harmonic frequencies for an open air column can be calculated using the equation above, where \(v\) is the speed of sound waves in air.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">For an air column that is <em>closed at one end</em>, only the open end is a node...</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The closed end becomes an anti-node since reflections of the compressions and rarefactions are not inverted.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">As a result, the length of the air column must be a multiple of <em>one-half the length</em> of the compressions or rarefactions (i.e. one-quarter of a wavelength), and the relationships between \(L\), \(\lambda\), and \(f\) become: $$\lambda=\frac{4L}{n}$$
        $$f_n=\frac{nv}{4L}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The value of \(n\) in these equations can only be an <em>odd</em> number. If we divided the wavelength by an even number, this would produce nodes at both ends, which is correct for an open air column but not for one that is closed.</li>

<h3>Resonance</h3>
<p>Resonance is the phenomenon whereby disturbances of initially small amplitude grow to very large amplitudes as a result of constructive interference.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>We saw that pendulums, buildings, and other objects that oscillate a specific frequency will resonate when driven at the resonance frequency.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">A string will begin to oscillate if there is a tuning fork or other source of sound waves at one of the string’s harmonic frequencies.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Similarly an air column will resonate when there are sound waves at one of the air column’s harmonic frequencies.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Harmonic frequencies are also called resonant frequencies.</li>
</ul>
