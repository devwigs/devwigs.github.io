<p>A <em class="Defn">wave</em> is defined as a disturbance that transports energy through a medium.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>Examples of waves include surface waves on water or other liquids, sound, light, and vibrations along a string (such as a guitar or violin string).</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The <em class="Defn">medium</em> refers to the material through which the wave travels.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The surface of a pond is the medium for waves travelling along the surface.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">When no waves are present, the pond surface is at equilibrium (flat).</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Waves are a disturbance because the medium has been disturbed from its equilibrium state.</li>
</ul>

<p data-slide="next">In general, the shape of a wave may be complicated...</P>
<p data-slide="next">...however, there is a mathematical theorem (discovered by Joseph Fourier) that states that any wave can be thought of as one or more sine or cosine shaped waves added together.</p>

<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>Consequently, we are interested primarily in these <em class="Defn">harmonic waves</em>.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Harmonic waves are produced when the individual points along the medium are all moving in SHM.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The period, frequency, and amplitude of a harmonic wave indicate the period, frequency, and amplitude of the SHM that each point exhibits.</li>
</ul>

<p data-slide="next"><em class="Defn">Transverse</em> waves are waves in which the direction of the particles’ SHM is <em>perpendicular</em> to the direction in which the wave transports energy.</p>
<p class="Center" data-slide="same"><b>Transverse Harmonic Wave</b></p>

<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>On a guitar string, for example, each point on the string oscillates perpendicular to the string (“particle velocity”), while the wave’s energy moves parallel to the string (“phase velocity”).</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Light waves are another example of a transverse wave.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The terms <em class="Defn">crest</em> and <em class="Defn">trough</em> are used to describe the highest and lowest points on a transverse wave relative to equilibrium.</li>
</ul>

<p data-slide="next"><em class="Defn">Longitudinal</em> waves have particle motion <em>parallel</em> to the phase velocity.</p>
<p class="Center" data-slide="same"><b>Longitudinal Harmonic Wave</b></p>

</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>Sound waves are longitudinal.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Surface waves on water have both transverse and longitudinal components.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Longitudinal waves do not have crests and troughs.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Instead, the points of highest and lowest density are called <em class="Defn">compressions</em> and <em class="Defn">rarefactions</em>.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">For a sound wave containing a single frequency (i.e. a harmonic wave), a graph of air pressure would be sine-shaped with the highest pressure at the compressions.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="next">For harmonic waves, the distance between any point on the wave (say a crest) and the corresponding point on the next wave is called the <em class="Defn">wavelength</em>.</p>
<ul data-slide="next"><li>The symbol for wavelength is \(\lambda\) (“lambda”), the Greek version of the letter “L”.</li></ul>

<p data-slide="next">A harmonic wave moves one wavelength in one period.</p>
<ul data-slide="next"><li>The phase speed is therefore: $$v=\frac{\lambda}{T}=\lambda f$$</li></ul>
