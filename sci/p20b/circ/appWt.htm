<p>We learned in an earlier lesson that the <em>sensation</em> of having weight is actually
    caused by the force or forces that balance gravity, often the normal force.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>This is because gravity acts uniformly over your entire body and does not create any stresses within your tissues that your body can sense.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">When you are accelerating, the forces acting on you are not balanced, so you may experience the sensation of having more (or less) apparent weight than usual.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Because circular motion involves acceleration and therefore requires an unbalanced force, you may experience this effect when undergoing significant centripetal accelerations. This is what makes midway rides like roller coasters exciting.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="next">Imagine you are at the top of a circular loop; for example, you might be riding your bike over a hill, or riding in a plane at the top of a circular climb.</p>
<p data-slide="same" class="Center"><img alt="Image" src="circ/img/appWt.png" class="Zoom" width="384"/></p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>The direction of the net force must be toward the centre, which in this example would be “down”. This means the magnitude of the upward (normal) force must be less than the downward force of gravity. As a result, you feel the sensation of reduced weight.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">When you are at the bottom of a circular loop, the centre of the circle, and therefore the direction of the net force, is “up”. This means that the magnitude of the upward normal force is greater than the downward force of gravity and you feel heavier than usual.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">To calculate your apparent weight, use Newton’s 2nd Law: $${\vec{\mathbf{F}}}_{net}=m{\vec{\mathbf{a}}}_c$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Remember that \({\vec{\mathbf F}}_{net} = {\vec{\mathbf F}}_g + {\vec{\mathbf F}}_n\) is the vector sum of the forces.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The magnitude of the acceleration vector for uniform circular motion must be: $$a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}=\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}$$</li>
</ul>
