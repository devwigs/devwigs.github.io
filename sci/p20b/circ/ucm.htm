<h3>Uniform Circular Motion</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Uniform circular motion</em> is motion along a <em>circular trajectory</em> with a <em>constant speed</em>.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>Because the <em>direction</em> of motion is always changing, the <em>velocity</em> is not constant.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="next">For motion along a circle, several new terms are commonly used to describe directions:</p>
<p data-slide="same" class="Center"><img alt="Image" src="circ/img/ucm.png" class="Zoom" width="440"/></p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li><em class="Defn">Centripetal</em> means the direction pointing directly toward from the circle’s centre, at any point on the circumference.</li>
    <li data-slide="next"><em class="Defn">Radial</em> means the direction pointing directly away from the circle’s centre, at any point on the circumference.</li>
    <li data-slide="next"><em class="Defn">Tangential</em> means the along the circle’s circumference, perpendicular to the centripetal and radial directions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dynamics of UCM</h3>
<p>According to Newton’s Laws, an unbalanced force is required to change the direction of the velocity vector.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>For uniform circular motion, the net force will always be in the <em>centripetal</em> direction.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">For example, Earth’s (nearly) circular orbit is caused by the Sun’s gravitational attraction.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">When scientists talk about “centripetal force”, they are only referring to the direction of the force, not to the type of force.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Centripetal force can be gravity (as in the Earth’s orbit), electric (as in the orbit of an electron in an atom), friction (as in a car rounding a curve), or any other type (or combination of types!) of force.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">“Centripetal force” in uniform circular motion is analogous to “restoring force” in SHM.</li>
</ul>

<h3>UCM Relations</h3>
<p>The time that it takes an object to complete one full circular orbit is called the <em class="Defn">period</em>.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>As for SHM, the symbol for period is a capital \(T\), to distinguish it from \(t\), which is the time coordinate.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Since the distance travelled each orbit is equal to the circumference of the circular orbit, \(2\pi r\), the period and the speed of the motion are related by the equation: $$v=\frac{2\pi r}{T}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Also like SHM, <em class="Defn">frequency</em> is the reciprocal of period: $$f=\frac{1}{T}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">While period measures the time per cycle or obit, frequency measures the number of cycles per second.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The SI unit of frequency is hertz (Hz = s<sup>–1</sup>).</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Frequency is sometimes measured in “rpm” (rotations per minute). To convert rpm to Hz, divide by 60 since Hz means rotations per second.</li>
</ul>
