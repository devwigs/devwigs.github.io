<p>Although the speed (scalar!) of an object is constant for uniform circular motion, the object’s <em>velocity</em> (vector!) is continuously changing due to changes in direction.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>This means that the object is <em>accelerating</em> and there must be an <em>unbalanced force</em> causing the object to move in a circle.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">If there was no unbalanced force, the object would have to move in a straight line.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="next">The illustration below (left) shows the motion of an object from \(P_1\) to \(P_2\) along a circle centred at point C. The illustration on the right is the vector diagram showing the change in velocity (\(\Delta{\vec{\mathbf v}}\)).</p>

<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>The blue and red triangles are <em>similar</em>; they are both isosceles triangles with the same angles.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Similar triangles have the same ratio of sides:$${s \over r} = {\Delta v\over v}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Since \(s\) is the distance from \(P_1\) to \(P_2\), \(s=v\Delta t\): $${v\Delta t\over r} = {\Delta v\over v}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">We can rearrange this to calculate the acceleration: $$a_c = {\Delta v\over \Delta t} = {v^2\over r}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The subscript “c” is for centripetal; it reminds us that the direction of the acceleration vector is always directed toward the centre for UCM.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">We can get an alternate form of the equation by substituting \(v = {2\pi r\over T}\) to eliminate \(v\):$$a_c=\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">These equations are valid only for the <em>instantaneous</em> acceleration;
        this is because the distance between \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) measured along the circular arc is only approximately equal to the line segment \(s\), when \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) are very close together.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The net force is also in the centripetal direction accoring to Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law:$${\vec{\mathbf{F}}}_{net}=m{\vec{\mathbf{a}}}_c$$</li>
