<p>If your <em>hypothesis</em> predicts an equation in which the variables (manipulated and/or responding) appear as a <em>power</em>:</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>Use the exponent from the equation to <em>transform</em> the data.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">If a variable appears in the denominator of a fraction, treat the exponent as negative.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">If a variable appears under a radical sign, treat the exponent as a fraction (1/2 for square root, 1/3 for cube root).</li>
    <li data-slide="next">If the hypothesis is correct, transforming the data will make the graph linear, allowing you to add a best-fit line.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Calculate the slope and intercept as you would for any line.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">When writing the model equation, use the transformed variable (i.e. the power) rather than the “raw” variable.</li>
</ul>

<p data-slide="next">If you do not have a <em>hypothesis</em> that predicts an equation:</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>Use a graphing calculator or statistics software to perform a <em class="Defn">power regression</em>.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Graphing the data and equation (on the calclator or computer) to see how well it fits your data.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">If power regression does not fit, you can try <em>exponential</em>, <em>quadratic</em>, <em>polynomial</em>, or other regressions.</li>
