<p>To <em class="Defn">add 2D vectors</em>, imagine an object undergoing two successive displacements direction) as illustrated in the vector diagram below.</p>

<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>We can take the original starting point as the origin.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The object moves from the origin to “A” and then continues to “B”.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Note that the second part of the displacement begins from the point (“A”) where the first displacement ends.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">As a result, the two displacement vectors must be drawn <em class="Defn">tip-to-tail</em>.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The object’s <em class="Defn">total displacement</em> is from its original starting point (origin) to its final end point (“B”).</li>
    <li data-slide="next">This vector, representing the <em>sum</em> of the two vectors, is called the <em class="Defn">resultant vector</em>.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Because \(\Delta{\vec{\mathbf{d}}}_1\) and \(\Delta{\vec{\mathbf{d}}}_2\) have different directions, the magnitude of the resultant vector will <b>not</b> equal the magnitudes of the two vectors added together.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="next">There are several methods we can use to find the resultant...</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li><b>Graphical Method</b>: Draw the “tip-to-tail” vector diagram on graph paper using a protractor and ruler. You can then measure the resultant vector. This method is not very accurate because it depends on the precision of your drawing and measurements.</li>
	<li data-slide="next"><b>Component Method</b>: The most accurate and reliable method of adding vectors is to express all vectors in Cartesian form and then calculate the \(x\)- and \(y\)-totals independently.</li>
	<li data-slide="next"><b>Trigonometry Method</b>: Sketch the “tip-to-tail” diagram and then solve for any unknown angles or sides using trigonometry relations. This method works when adding two vectors at a time but cannot be used to add three or more vectors at once. If the vectors being added are not perpendicular, you cannot use the Pythagoras formula or the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios, but instead must use the Sine and/or Cosine Laws.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="next">The procedures for adding vectors and drawing vector diagrams (“tip-to-tail”) are not just for displacement vectors but for any kind of vector, including velocity, acceleration, and force.</p>
<p data-slide="next">To <em class="Defn">subtract</em> a vector, add its negative.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>In Cartesian form, reverse the sign of both components.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">In polar form, add or subtract 180º to the direction.</li>
</ul>
