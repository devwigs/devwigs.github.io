<p><em class="Defn">Projectile motion</em> is the 2D version of uniformly accelerated motion.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>This type of motion typically occurs when gravity causes a <em>constant acceleration</em> (if we ignore air resistance) in the \(–y\) direction while the object’s velocity has both \(x\)- and \(y\)-components.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The shape of a projectile’s trajectory is a <em>parabola</em>.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">We know this because the relationship between the \(x\)- and \(y\)-components of the displacement is quadratic.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">(You will study quadratic functions in Math 20.)</li>
    <li data-slide="next">For a typical projectile problem, you will express all four of your kinematic vectors (acceleration, initial and final velocity, displacement) in <b><u>Cartesian</u></b> form.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The fifth variable, time, is a scalar so it does not have separate \(x\)- and \(y\)-values.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Also, because there is no \(x\)-acceleration (gravity acts only in the \(y\)-direction), the initial and final \(x\)-velocities are the same.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">To solve for any unknowns, treat the \(x\) and \(y\)-parts of the motions as two separate problems to be solved independently.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The only mathematical connection between the components is that they occur over the same amount of time.</li>
