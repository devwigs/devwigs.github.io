<h3>Kepler’s 3rd Law, Again</h3>
<p>Let’s reconsider the case of a mass (\(m\)) orbiting in uniform circular motion around a very large central mass (\(M\)).</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>We know for uniform circular motion that the orbiting object’s acceleration is directed toward the centre of its circular orbit and has a magnitude of $$a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}=\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">If the central mass is much larger than any other nearby mass, then the gravitational field will be dominated by the central mass’s contribution: $$|\vec{\mathbf{g}}|=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">If there are no forces other than gravity, we know that \(\vec{\mathbf{a}}=\vec{\mathbf{g}}\)!</li>
    <li data-slide="next">This would not be the case if, for example, the orbiting mass was moving under rocket thrust, or if it was moving through an atmosphere.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">By substituting the equations for \(\vec{\mathbf{a}}\) and \(\vec{\mathbf{g}}\) we get: $$\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">We can rearrange this as: $$4\pi^2r^3=GMT^2$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">This is Kepler’s 3rd Law, expressed in terms of the central mass rather than the “Kepler coefficient” (\(k\))!</li>

<h3>Planetary &amp; Stellar Masses</h3>
<p>This equation gives us a means of calculating masses (\(M\)) for stars and planets by measuring the orbital radius (\(r\)) and period (\(T\)) of objects in orbit.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>We can determine Earth’s mass using the radius and period of the Moon’s orbit.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">We can determine the Sun’s mass from the radius and period of Earth’s orbit.</li>

<h3>Geosynchronous Orbits</h3>
<p>When a satellite has the same period as the planet’s rotation (e.g. 24 hours for Earth), the orbit is called <em class="Defn">geosynchronous</em>.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>A satellite in a geosynchronous orbit passes over the same point on the ground at the same time each day.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">A circular, geosynchronous orbit around the equator is called <em class="Defn">geostationary</em>.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The satellite remains in orbit permanently above the same point on the ground.</li>
</ul>
