<p>In 1797, Henry Cavendish conducted laboratory measurements of the gravitational force between two pairs of large masses.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>Cavendish used a <em class="Defn">torsion balance</em> apparatus that had been designed by John Mitchell (who had died before being able to do the experiment himself.)</li>
</ul>

<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>Torsion means “twisting”, and the torsion balance works by balancing twisting forces (“torques”).</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Two identical masses (\(m\)) are attached to a horizontal rod, which is precisely balanced at its centre.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The apparatus is suspended on a rope or wire attached to the ceiling.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">When additional masses (\(M\)) are brought close to the suspended ones, gravitational attraction causes the wire to twist until the apparatus reaches equilibrium, where the “torque” produced by the twisted wire balances the torque due to the gravitational attraction.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">If the apparatus has been calibrated in advance, one can determine the magnitude of the gravitational force by how many degrees the apparatus moves from its original equilibrium.</li>
</ul>

<p data-slide="next">In this experiment, the masses (\(m\) and \(M\)), are <em>controlled</em> while the separation (\(r\)) is <em>manipulated</em>.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>The <em>responding</em> variable is the gravitational force (\(F_g\)).</li>
    <li data-slide="next">By analyzing the data, one can determine that the gravitational force does obey Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation: $$F_g=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Note that the data is non-linear as the equation is an inverse square law.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Since \(r\), \(F_g\), \(m\) and \(M\) are all measured as part of the experiment, the value of \(G\) can be determined.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The value obtained from Cavendish’s data was within 2% of the modern accepted value: $$G=6.67\times{10}^{-11}\mathrm{\frac{N\cdot m^2}{kg^2}}$$</li>
