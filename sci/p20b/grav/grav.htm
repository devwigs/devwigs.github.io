<p>Consider a planet orbiting around the Sun in a circular orbit...</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>The planet’s centripetal acceleration due to the Sun’s gravity is: $$g=a_c=\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The planet’s motion must also obey Kepler’s 3rd Law, which allows us to substitute \(T^2=kr^3\), thereby eliminating \(T\) from the equation: $$g=\frac{4\pi^2r}{kr^3}=\frac{4\pi^2}{kr^2}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Using \(m\) as the planet’s mass, the gravitational force is: $$F_g=mg=\frac{4\pi^2m}{kr^2}$$</li>
</ul>

<p data-slide="next">According to Newton’s 3rd Law the planet’s gravity must exert a force on the Sun that is equal in magnitude to the force of the Sun’s gravity on the planet.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>Since the force depends directly on the mass of the planet (i.e. there is an \(m\) in the numerator), it must also be directly proportional to the mass of the Sun, \(M\).</li>
    <li data-slide="next">This means that the “constant” \(4\pi^2/k\) in the equation must equal the mass of the Sun (\(M\)) multiplied by some universal constant. This constant is called the universal gravitational constant and is represented by the symbol \(G\):
        $$F_g=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
        $$g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$</li>
</ul>

<p data-slide="next">Newton proposed that these equations apply not only to circular orbits but are universal.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>In other words, any two masses (no matter how small), will exert a gravitational attraction on each other according to the equations above.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">This equation is known as <em class="Defn">Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation</em>.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The variable \(r\) can no longer be called the “radius” because, if Newton is correct, the equation does not require circular motion. Instead, \(r\) is called the <em class="Defn">separation</em> between the objects.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">This variable is always measured from the <em>centres</em> of the objects.</li>
</ul>

<p data-slide="next">The Law of Universal Gravitation is an “inverse square law” because, as the objects get further apart, the force gets weaker by a factor of \(r^2\).</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>In other words, when the separation between the objects doubles, the gravitational force becomes only <em>one-quarter</em> as strong.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The value of the constant \(G\) must be determined experimentally.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">To three significant digits, the accepted value is $$G=6.67\times{10}^{-11}\mathrm{\frac{N\cdot m^2}{kg^2}}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">This means that two masses of 1.00 kg each separated by a distance of 1.00 m, will attract each other with a miniscule \(6.67 \times 10^{–11}\ \mathrm{N}\) of gravitational force!</li>
</ul>
