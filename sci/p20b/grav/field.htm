<h3>Action at a Distance</h3>
<p>Newton’s equation for gravitational force implies that the force between masses can act over large distances.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>Each mass somehow “knows” the position and the motion of all of the other distant masses that affect it gravitationally.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">Scientists found this action at a distance to be a very complicated way of running the universe and sought a simpler explanation of the gravitational attraction.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gravitational Field</h3>
<p>They devised the concept of a <em class="Defn">gravitational field</em>...</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>The idea of a field is that every mass causes the space around it to become distorted, and each mass moves within the distorted space that it finds itself in.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">As an analogy, think of two bowling balls placed on a trampoline...</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The bowling balls will roll toward each other, as if there were some force of attraction between them.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">What really happens is that the bowling balls change the shape of the trampoline, and each ball rolls according to the shape of the trampoline in its own location.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">If we place a large number of bowling balls, baseballs, and golf balls on the trampoline, each one will affect the shape of the surface; the bowling balls will have more effect than the golf balls!</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The shape of the trampoline will become very complicated and each ball will roll in a complicated trajectory.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">However, in this model none of the various objects needs to know where any of the other objects is located.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sources & Test Masses</h3>
<p>To <em>measure</em> the shape of the trampoline at any particular spot, as a result of all the masses on the trampoline, we can observe a small object at that spot, say a ping-pong ball which is light enough to have negligible effect on the trampoline’s shape. The ping-pong ball’s acceleration will tell us how steeply and in what direction the trampoline slopes.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>If we can think of space as a 3D trampoline, the gravitational field represents its “shape”.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">We measure the gravitational field by placing a tiny <em class="Defn">test mass</em> at some point in space, and by observing its acceleration when there are no forces except gravity acting on it.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The masses that create the gravitational field are known as the <em class="Defn">field masses</em>, or the <em class="Defn">sources</em> of the field.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Equations</h3>
<p>The gravitational field due to a single source can be calculated from Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation and Newton’s 2nd Law.</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>The force that the single source (\(M\)) causes on the test mass (\(m\)), is: $$|{\vec{\mathbf{F}}}_g|=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">According to Newton’s 2nd Law, to calculate the field (acceleration of the test mass), we need to divide the force by the test mass:
        $$|\vec{\mathbf{g}}|=\frac{|{\vec{\mathbf{F}}}_g|}{m}=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The vector \(\vec{\mathbf{g}}\) is the gravitational field.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The gravitational field vector and the test mass acceleration \(\vec{\mathbf{a}}\) are the same provided that gravity is the only force present.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">When there are other forces, \(\vec{\mathbf{a}}\) will not equal \(\vec{\mathbf{g}}\).</li>
    <li data-slide="next">If there is more than one source present, we can use the above expression, \(GM/r^2\), to calculate each source’s effect on the test mass, and then determine the net gravitational field (i.e. the test mass’s acceleration) by doing a vector addition of all sources’ contributions to the field.</li>
