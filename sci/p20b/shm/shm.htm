<p><em class="Defn">Simple harmonic motion</em> is an oscillation where the motion of the object is described exactly by a sine-shaped function.</p>

    <li>SHM occurs near an equilibrium when the restoring force is directly proportional to the object’s position, measured relative to equilibrium.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">We will sometimes use the symbol \(\vec{\mathbf{x}}\) to represent the position relative to equilibrium, rather than \(\vec{\mathbf{d}}\) for position relative to an arbitrary origin.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The relationship between the restoring force and position can be described by the equation:
        $$\vec{\mathbf F}_{net} = -k\vec{\mathbf x}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="next">The object’s velocity and position are “out of sync” with each other in SHM: when the object is furthest from equilibrium (the highest and lowest points of the \(\vec{\mathbf{x}}-t\) graph) the velocity is zero and when the object passes through equilibrium its speed is a maximum.</li>
</ul>

<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>This can be understood in terms of energy conservation: kinetic energy (related to speed) is at a maximum when potential energy (related to distance from equilibrium) is at a minimum.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">One interesting property of sinusoidal functions is that the slope will also be sinusoidal but <em>shifted by one-quarter of a period</em>!</li>
    <li data-slide="next">If the \(\vec{\mathbf{x}}-t\) graph can be described by a sine function, the \(\vec{\mathbf{v}}-t\) graph will be a cosine function and the \(\vec{\mathbf{a}}-t\) graph will be a negative sine function.</li>

<p>All three motion graphs have the same time scale (period).</p>
<p data-slide="next">The vertical scales of the three motion graphs are related by the following relationships:</p>
<p data-slide="next">$$v_{max} ={2\pi A\over T}$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">$$a_{max} = {v_{max}^2 \over A} = {4\pi^2 A\over T^2}$$</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>The proof of these equations requires calculus; however, we can demonstrate experimentally that these relationships are correct.</li>
</ul>

<p class="Blue" data-slide="next">Example: A simple pendulum is constructed so that it will have a period of 2.00 seconds and a maximum acceleration of 0.500 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Assuming the motion is SHM, calculate the speed of the mass as it passes through equilibrium and the amplitude of the motion.</p>
<p data-slide="next">Since we know the period and maximum acceleration, we can find the amplitude from the \(a_{max}\) equation above:
    $$a_{max} = {4\pi^2 A\over T^2}$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">$$a_{max}T^2 = 4\pi^2 A$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">$${a_{max}T^2 \over 4\pi^2} = A$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">Evaluating:$$A = \mathrm{{(0.500\ m/s^2) (2.00\ s)^2 \over 4\pi^2} = 0.0507\ m}$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">We can then calculate \(v_{max}\) from the other equation:
    $$v_{max} = {2\pi A \over T} = \mathrm{{2\pi (0.0507\ m) \over (2.00\ s)} = 0.159\ m/s}$$</p>
