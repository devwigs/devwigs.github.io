<p>The restoring (net) force on a simple pendulum is the resultant of the gravitational and tension forces, as shown in the free body diagram and the vector diagram below.</p>

<p data-slide="next">By applying trigonometry to the right triangles in both diagrams:
    $$\sin{\theta}=\frac{x_0}{L}=\frac{F_{net}}{mg}$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">The requirement for SHM is \(F_{net} = kx\). If we use this equation to eliminate \(F_{net}\) from the above:
    $$\frac{x_0}{L}=\frac{kx}{mg}$$
    $$k=\frac{mg}{L}\cdot\frac{x_0}{x}$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">This shows that the motion of a simple pendulum is not SHM,
    because \(x\) (distance from equilibrium measured along a circular arc) and \(x_0\)
    (distance from equilibrium measured horizontally) are not constant as the pendulum moves.
    However, if the maximum angle is small (30° or less), \(x\) and \(x_0\) are approximately equal,
    so we can cancel them to get: $$k\cong\frac{mg}{L}$$ which is constant.</p>
<p data-slide="next">We can calculate the period of a simple pendulum by substituting this \(k\) value into the equation for period of SHM:
    $$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{\left(\frac{mg}{L}\right)}}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">Since the mass cancelled, the period of a simple pendulum is independent of the mass!</p>
<ul data-slide="next">
    <li>Galileo would agree with this result since gravity is the force driving the motion. The length of the pendulum and the gravitational field strength are the factors that determine the pendulum’s period.</li>
    <li data-slide="next">When the effects of air resistance are included, mass and amplitude do affect the period to some extent (but not as much as the length does.)</li>

<p class="Blue">Example 1: A grandfather clock uses a pendulum as a timing device. The simplest design is to use a pendulum with a period of exactly 1.00 or 2.00 seconds, to advance the clock’s second hand either once per period, or whenever the pendulum passes equilibrium (twice per period). Determine the lengths of the pendulums need to give the desired periods.</p>
<p data-slide="next">Rearrange the equation to isolate \(L\): $$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">$$T^2=4\pi^2\frac{L}{g}$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">$$gT^2=4\pi^2 L$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">$$\frac{gT^2}{4\pi^2}=L$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">Evaluate for a period of 1.00 s: $$L = \mathrm{{9.81\cdot m/s^2 (1.00\ s)^2 \over 4\pi^2} = 0.248\ m}$$</p>
<p data-slide="next">Evaluate for a period of 2.00 s: $$L = \mathrm{{9.81\cdot m/s^2 (2.00\ s)^2 \over 4\pi^2} = 0.994\ m}$$</p>
