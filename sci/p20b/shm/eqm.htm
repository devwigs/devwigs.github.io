    <li>An object placed at rest at equilibrium will remain at rest there, according to Newton’s Laws.</li>
    <li data-slide="2">An equilibrium is <em class="Defn">unstable</em> when any object close to the equilibrium experiences a net force that accelerates it away from the equilibrium position.</li>
    <li data-slide="3">Near the top of a hill, the unbalanced force produced by the gravity and normal forces points downhill, away from the equilibrium at the top.</li>
    <li data-slide="4">An equilibrium is <em class="Defn">stable</em> when objects close to the equilibrium experience a restoring force: an unbalanced force that accelerates the object back toward equilibrium.</li>
    <li data-slide="5">Near the bottom of a valley, the gravity and normal forces produce an unbalanced force that pulls the object back toward its equilibrium at the bottom.</li>
    <li data-slide="6">The net force may be described as a <em class="Defn">restoring force</em> because it acts to restore the equilibrium.</li>
    <li data-slide="7">Objects near a stable equilibrium will move back-and-forth across the equilibrium, as a result of their inertia which causes them to “overshoot”. This type of motion is called an <em class="Defn">oscillation</em>.</li>

<p data-slide="9">The simplest mathematical function that can describe an oscillation is a sinusoidal (sine or cosine) function.</p>
<p data-slide="10">Motion that can be described exactly by a sinusoidal function is called <em class="Defn">simple harmonic motion</em> (SHM).</p>
<p data-slide="11">SHM is characterized by two quantities that can be measured from the \(\vec{\mathbf d}-t\) graph:</p>
<ul data-slide="12">
	<li><em class="Defn">Amplitude</em> (\(A\)) is the maximum distance that the object moves from its equilibrium position.</li>
	<li data-slide="13"><em class="Defn">Period</em> (\(T\)) is the time it takes for each cycle or repetition of the motion.</li>
	<li data-slide="14">The reciprocal of period is called <em class="Defn">frequency</em>:$$f = {1\over T}$$</li>
    <li data-slide="15">The unit of frequency is called hertz: Hz = s<sup>–1</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="16">We will see in a future lesson that SHM occurs when the restoring force is <em>directly proportional</em> to the object’s distance from equilibrium.</p>
<ul data-slide="17"><li>E.g. an object will experience exactly twice as much net force when it is 10 cm from equilibrium compared to when it is only 5 cm from equilibrium.</li></ul>
