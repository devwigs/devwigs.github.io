    <li>Since Earth exerts a gravitational force on your desk, does your desk exert a gravitational force on the Earth?  Why is it easier to observe the effects of the action force (Earth pulling on the desk) than the reaction force (desk pulling on Earth)?</li>
    <div class="Answer">According to Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law, the Earth and the desk exert equal and opposite forces on each other. The desk’s gravity has negligible effect on the Earth because the Earth’s mass is <b><u>WAY</u></b> bigger.</div>

    <li>A 53.2 kg student standing on an icy sidewalk leans against a lamppost, exerting a force of 60.0 N on the post.<ol type="a">
        <li>What is the student’s acceleration?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The force on the student is the negative of the force he or she exerts on the lamppost...
$$\vec{\mathbf a} = \frac{\vec{\mathbf F}}{m} = \mathrm{\frac{-60.0\ N}{53.2\ kg} = -1.13\ m/s^2}$$</div>
    
        <li>Why does the lamppost not accelerate even though the student is exerting a force on it?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The lamppost is attached to the ground. The ground exerts enough force to balance the force applied by the student.</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li>An archer shoots a 318 g arrow from her bow. The bowstring accelerates the arrow to a final velocity of 34.0 m/s over 82.5 cm.<ol type="a">
        <li>Determine the acceleration and force experienced by the arrow.</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$\begin{align}
\vec{\mathbf a} &= \frac{v_f^2 - v_i^2}{2\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}}
\\ &= \mathrm{\frac{(34.0\ m/s)^2 - (0.00\ m/s)^2}{2\cdot 0.825\ m}}
\\ &= \mathrm{+701\ m/s^2}
\\
\\ \vec{\mathbf F} &= m\vec{\mathbf a} \\ &= \mathrm{0.318\ kg\cdot (+701\ m/s^2)} \\ &= \mathrm{+223\ N}
\end{align}$$</div>

        <li>What recoil force does the archer experience through the bow?</li>
        <div class="Answer">According to Newton’s 3rd Law, the archer experiences a recoil of –223 N.</div>

        <li>If the 59.1 kg archer shoots while standing on a perfectly frictionless surface, what would her acceleration be?</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$\vec{\mathbf a} = \frac{\vec{\mathbf F}}{m} = \mathrm{\frac{-223\ N}{59.1\ kg} = -3.77\ m/s^2}$$</div>

        <li>Why does the archer not accelerate when she shoots while standing on grass, dirt or concrete?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The friction produced by the ground would balance the recoil applied by the bow.</div>

    <li>A 1.45 × 10<sup>4</sup> kg bus and a 1.07 × 10<sup>4</sup> kg car moving in the opposite direction collide head-on. The bus “decelerates” at 12.0 m/s<sup>2</sup> during the collision.<ol type="a">
        <li>What is the car’s acceleration?</li>
        <div class="Answer">First find the net force acting on the bus...
$$\vec{\mathbf F} = m\vec{\mathbf a} = \mathrm{1.45\times 10^4\ kg\cdot (-12.0\ m/s^2) = -1.74\times 10^5\ N}$$
The force acting on the car is \(\vec{\mathbf F} = \mathrm{+1.74\times 10^5\ N}\) according to Newton’s 3rd Law. For the car...
$$\vec{\mathbf a} = \frac{\vec{\mathbf F}}{m} = \mathrm{\frac{+1.74\times 10^5\ N}{1.07\times 10^3\ kg} = +163\ m/s^2}$$
        </div>

        <li>Explain why seatbelts are mandatory in cars while many busses are not equipped with seatbelts.</li>
        <div class="Answer">During a collision, passengers in a more massive vehicle will experience less acceleration than those in a smaller vehicle. The risk of injury is greater for those in the lighter vehicle.</div>

    <li>An asteroid at rest explodes into two pieces.  During the explosion, the two fragments exert forces on each other over a time interval of 0.750 s.  One piece has a mass of 1240 kg and a velocity of 523 m/s after the explosion. Determine the force that the pieces exert on each other and the final velocity of the second fragment, which has a mass of 874 kg.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Calculate the acceleration and force on the 1240 kg object...
$$\begin{align}
    \vec{\mathbf a} &= \frac{\vec{\mathbf v}_f - \vec{\mathbf v}_i}{\Delta t}
    \\ &= \mathrm{\frac{+523\ m/s - 0.00\ m/s}{0.750\ s}}
    \\ &= \mathrm{+697\ m/s^2}
\end{align}$$
$$\begin{align}
    \vec{\mathbf F} &= m\vec{\mathbf a}
    \\ &= \mathrm{1240\ kg\cdot (+697\ m/s^2)}
    \\ &= \mathrm{+8.65\times 10^5\ N}
\end{align}$$
Calculate the acceleration of the 874 kg object using the opposite force...
$$\vec{\mathbf a} = \frac{\vec{\mathbf F}}{m} = \mathrm{\frac{-8.65\times 10^5\ N}{874\ kg} = -989\ m/s^2}$$
Calculate the final velocity...
$$\begin{align}
    \vec{\mathbf v}_f &= \vec{\mathbf a}\Delta t + \vec{\mathbf v}_i 
    \\ &= \mathrm{-989\ m/s^2\cdot 0.750\ s + 0.00\ m/s}
    \\ &= \mathrm{-742\ m/s}
\end{align}$$
