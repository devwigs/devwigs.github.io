<h1 class="SlideOnly">Contact Forces</h1>
<p>When two solid objects are in <em>contact with</em> each other, they exert a normal force and a friction force on each other.</p>
<ul data-slide="1">
	<li>The <em class="Defn">normal force</em> acts <em>perpendicular</em> to the surface of contact and pushes the objects apart.</li>
	<li data-slide="2">The <em class="Defn">friction force</em> acts <em>parallel</em> to the surface to oppose any relative motion between the objects.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="3">Observations have lead scientists to conclude that the maximum force of friction often depends directly on the normal force.</p>
<!--p data-slide="10+" class="NoPrint">$$|{\vec{\mathbf F}}_f| = \mu |{\vec{\mathbf F}}_n|$$</p-->
<ul data-slide="4">
	<li>Doubling the normal force will double the force of friction as well.</li>
	<li data-slide="5">For example, if you push down on object, that increases the normal force and makes it harder to drag the object horizontally because friction will increase in proportion to the normal force.</li>
	<li data-slide="6">This observation is written in the form of an equation:$$|{\vec{\mathbf F}}_f| = \mu |{\vec{\mathbf F}}_n|$$</li>
	<li data-slide="7">The symbol \(\mu\) is called the <em class="Defn">coefficient of friction</em>.</li>
	<li data-slide="8">It is simply the <em>ratio</em> of the friction force to the normal force.</li>
	<li data-slide="9">A coefficient of 0.40 means that the friction force is 40% as strong as the normal force.</li>
	<li data-slide="10">A smaller value of \(\mu\) indicates a “slippery” surface (not much friction).</li>
	<li data-slide="11">A larger value indicates a rougher surface with more friction.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="12">The value of \(\mu\) does not depend much on how fast the object is sliding along the surface, but it does depend on whether or not the object is stationary or moving.</p>
<ul data-slide="13">
	<li>The value of \(\mu\) when the object is stationary is called the coefficient of <em class="Defn">static friction</em> (\(\mu_s\)) and its value when the object is moving is the coefficient of <em class="Defn">kinetic friction</em> (\(\mu_k\)).</li>
	<li data-slide="14">In most cases, \(\mu_s > \mu_k\), meaning the maximum friction acting on the stationary object will be greater than when the object is moving.</li>
</ul>

<p class="Blue">Example: A 2.00-kilogram book rests on a horizontal surface that has a coefficient of static friction of 0.400 and kinetic friction of 0.340. How much force must be applied to make the book start moving?</p>
<p data-slide="16">$$F_n = F_g = mg = {\mathrm{2.00\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 = 19.6\ N}}$$</p>
<p data-slide="17">$$F_f = \mu_s F_n = {\mathrm{0.400\cdot 19.6\ N = 7.85\ N}}$$</p>
<p data-slide="18">The applied force must exceed 7.85 newtons to ovecome the friction.</p>
<p class="Blue" data-slide="19">What will be the book’s acceleration when the applied force is 10.0 newtons?</p>
<p data-slide="20">$$F_f = \mu_k F_n = {\mathrm{0.340\cdot 19.6\ N = 6.67\ N}}$$</p>
<p data-slide="21">$${\vec{\mathbf F}}_{net} = {\vec{\mathbf F}}_a + {\vec{\mathbf F}}_f = {\mathrm{+10.0\ N + (-6.67\ N) = +3.33\ N}}$$</p>
<p data-slide="22">$${\vec{\mathbf a}} = {{\vec{\mathbf F}}_{net} \over m} = {\mathrm{{+3.33\ N\over 2.00\ kg} = +1.67\ m/s^2}}$$</p>
