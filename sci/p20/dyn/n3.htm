<p>A force is an <em>interaction</em> between two objects.</p>
<ul data-slide="1">
	<li>When you push on an object (action), the object pushes back on you (reaction).</li>
</ul>
	<p data-slide="2">Newton observed that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-slide="2">the action and reaction always occur together,</li>
        <li data-slide="3">they are equal in magnitude,</li>
        <li data-slide="4">they act in opposite directions.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p data-slide="5"><em class="Defn">Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law</em>: For every action (force), there is an equal and opposite reaction force:$${\vec{\mathbf F}}_{AB} = -{\vec{\mathbf F}}_{BA}$$</p>

	<li>When you climb a rope, you cause the rope to exert an upward force on you by exerting a downward force on the rope.</li>
	<li data-slide="7">When you walk or run, you make the ground push you forward by push backward against the ground.</li>
	<li data-slide="8">Jet and rocket propulsion work by forcing gas out the “back” of the engine, causing the gas to propel the vessel forward.</li>
	<li data-slide="9">Since Earth exerts a gravitational force on you, you must exert an equal gravitational force on the Earth!</li>
