<h1>Gravitational Field</h1>
<p>Galileo observed that all objects moving under gravity have the <em>same acceleration</em> when there are no other forces affecting the motion (e.g. air resistance or applied forces.)</p>
<ul data-slide="1">
	<li>The Ancient Greek scientists thought heavy objects would fall faster.</li>
	<li data-slide="2">Differences in acceleration are due to air rersistance; objects with a relatively large cross-sectional area will experience more effects due to air resistance.</li>
	<li data-slide="3">On the surface of Earth, the value of the acceleration of gravity (also called the gravitational field strength) is, on average \(|{\vec{\mathbf g}}| = {\mathrm{9.81\ m/s^2}}\).</li>
	<li data-slide="4">The actual value of \(|{\vec{\mathbf g}}|\) on Earth varies slightly depending on altitude and latitude.</li>
	<li data-slide="5">On the Moon, the approximate value of \(|{\vec{\mathbf g}}|\) is \({\mathrm{1.63\ m/s^2}}\).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Mass &amp; Weight</h1>
<p>The <em class="Defn">mass</em> (\(m\)) of an object describes the:</p>
<ul data-slide="7">
	<li>amount of <em>matter</em> that the object contains</li>
	<li data-slide="8">how much <em>inertia</em> the object possesses (how difficult it is to change the object’s motion).</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="9">Mass does <em>not</em> depend on gravity: a 1 kg mass on the Moon contains just as much matter as the same 1 kg object on Earth.</p>
<p data-slide="10">An object’s <em class="Defn">weight</em> (\({\vec{\mathbf F}}_g\)) is the force that gravity exerts on the object.</p>
<ul data-slide="11">
	<li>Weight depends on both the object’s mass and on the gravitational field strength.</li>
	<li data-slide="12">Since the acceleration is \(\vec{\mathbf g}\) when gravity is the only force acting, according to Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law the relationship between mass and weight is:$${\vec{\mathbf F}}_g = m{\vec{\mathbf g}}$$</li>
	<li data-slide="13">This means for example, that a 1.00 kg object weighs 9.81 N on Earth.</li>
	<li data-slide="14">The same 1.00 kg object when placed on the Moon weighs only 1.63 N.</li>
	<li data-slide="15">A 1.00 kg object in deep space, far from any sources of gravity, has no weight at all.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Apparent Weight</h1>
<p>It is <em>not</em> possible to sense or feel the force of gravity in a uniform gravitational field.</p>
<p data-slide="17">Because uniform gravity acts <em>equally</em> on all parts of your body, it does not create any stresses in your tissues that your body is able to feel.</p>
<p data-slide="18">Ironically, the sensation of having weight is created by all of the forces acting on you <em>except</em> for gravity.</p>
<ul data-slide="19">
	<li>When you are standing, the normal force of the floor acting on your feet creates stress in your ankles, knees, etc. that gives your body the sensation of weight.</li>
	<li data-slide="20">When you are accelerating, the forces acting on you are not balanced, and you may feel the sensation of increased or decreased apparent weight.</li>
	<li data-slide="21">For example, you feel heavy when you begin to ascend in an elevator, and light when the elevator begins to slow down.</li>
</ul>
