<h1>Inertia</h1>
<p>If you stop pushing on an object, it will begin to slow and eventually come to rest.</p>
<ul data-slide="1">
	<li>How long it takes to come to rest depends on how much friction and air resistance are present, since these are the forces responsible for transforming the kinetic energy into other energy forms.</li>
	<li data-slide="2">If there were no forces acting on the object at all — including no friction or air resistance — the object would continue to move <em>forever</em> with a <em>constant velocity</em>, since its kinetic energy would not change.</li>
	<li data-slide="3">Since there is no air resistance outside the atmosphere, objects in space (planets, asteroids, comets) move without slowing.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="4">The tendency of objects to move with constant velocity is called <em class="Defn">inertia</em>.</p>
<ul data-slide="5">
	<li>The Law of Inertia was first stated by Galileo in the early 1600’s, before the Law of Energy Conservation had even been discovered.</li>
	<li data-slide="6">When he wrote his book on motion, Newton adopted the Law of Inertia as his first law of motion</em>...</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="7"><em class="Defn">Newton’s 1<sup>st</sup> Law</em>: Objects at rest tend to remain at rest and objects in motion tend to remain in motion with constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</p>
<ul data-slide="8">
	<li>In other words, <em>uniform motion</em> is the natural state of motion for objects when they are not interacting with other objects.</li>

<h1>Force</h1>
<p>On their own, objects move in uniform motion.</p>
<p data-slide="10">To make an object <em>accelerate</em> (speed up, slow down, or change direction) requires a <em class="Defn">force</em>.</p>
<ul data-slide="11">
	<li>An object’s <em>mass</em> determines its inertia; larger masses are more difficult to accelerate.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="12"><em class="Defn">Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law</em>: When an object experiences an unbalanced force, it will accelerate according to the equation $${\vec{\mathbf F}}_{net} = m{\vec{\mathbf a}}$$</p>
<ul data-slide="13">
	<li>If more than one force acts on the object, \({\vec{\mathbf F}}_{net}\) is the vector sum of all the individual forces.</li>
	<li data-slide="14">The SI unit of force is the newton: \(\mathrm{N = kg\cdot m/s^2}\).</li>
</ul>

<p class="Blue">Example 1: How much force is needed to make a 2.00-kilogram textbook accelerate as 4.00 m/s<sup>2</sup>?</p>
<p data-slide="16">$${\vec{\mathbf F}}_{net} = m{\vec{\mathbf a}} = \mathrm{2.00\ kg \cdot 4.00\ m/s^2 = 8.00\ N}$$</p>
<p data-slide="17" class="Blue">Example 2: What is the acceleration of a 25.0 kg child being pushed on a swing when the net force is 90.0 N?</p>
<p data-slide="18">$${\vec{\mathbf a}} = {\vec{\mathbf F}_{net} \over m} = \mathrm{{90.0\ N\over 25.0\ kg} = 3.60\ m/s^2}$$</p>
