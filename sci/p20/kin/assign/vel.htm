<h3>Practice</h3>

<li>How long will it take an aircraft that travels at 425 km/h to fly 550 km from Edmonton to Saskatoon?
<div class="Answer">
    <p>Rearrange the speed equation to isolate the time:
        $$v = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}$$
        $$v \Delta t = \Delta d$$
        $$\Delta t = \frac{\Delta d}{v}$$
    </p>
    <p>We could convert to standard SI units, but this is not necessary because the km cancels:
        $$\Delta t = \mathrm{\frac{550\ km}{425\ km/h} = 1.29\ h = 4659\ s}$$
    </p>
</div></li>

<li>A car drives from Edmonton to Calgary, a displacement of 285 km [south], in 3.25 hours.
<ol type="a">
    <li>What is the car’s average velocity?
    <div class="Answer">
        $$\vec{\mathbf v} = \frac{\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}}{\Delta t} = \mathrm{\frac{285\ km\ [S]}{3.25\ h} = 87.7\ km/h = 24.4\ m/s}$$
    </div></li>

    <li>Explain why the car’s average speed will be greater than the magnitude of the average velocity.
    <div class="Answer">Unless the car travels in a perfectly constant direction, the displacement (measured in a staight line) will be less than the distance (measured along the car’s path), so the average velocity will be less than the speed.</div></li>

<li>A hiker follows a circular path, walking at an average speed of 5.00 km/h.  After 3.20 hours of walking, he returns to her starting point, finishing one complete lap.
<ol type="a">
    <li>What is the hiker’s distance traveled?
    <div class="Answer">
    <p>Rearrange the speed equation to isolate the distance:
        $$v = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}$$
        $$\Delta d = v \Delta t = \mathrm{5.00\ km/h\cdot 3.20\ h = 16.0\ km}$$
    </p>
    </div></li>

    <li>What is the hiker’s displacement and average velocity?
    <div class="Answer">Since the hiker returns to his starting point (\(\vec{\mathbf d}_f = \vec{\mathbf d}_i\)), the displacement will be zero and the average velocity will therefore be zero as well!</div></li>
</ol></li>

<li>A long-distance runner maintains an average speed of 12.0 km/h while training. If she runs for 85.0 min, what distance did she cover?
<div class="Answer">
    <p>Convert to standard SI units:
        $$v = \mathrm{12.0\ km/h = 12.0\times\frac{1000\ m}{3600\ s} = 3.33\ m/s}$$
        $$\Delta t = \mathrm{85.0\ min = 85.0 (60.0\ s) = 5100\ s}$$
    </p>
    <p>Rearrange the speed equation to isolate the distance:
        $$v = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}$$
        $$\Delta d = v \Delta t = \mathrm{3.33\ m/s\cdot 5100\ s = 1.70\times 10^4\ m = 17.0\ km}$$
    </p>
