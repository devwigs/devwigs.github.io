<li>The graph below illustrates the motion of an elevator ascending inside a tall building.

<ol type="a">
    <li>Based on the appearance of the graph, is the motion of the elevator uniform or accelerated? Explain.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Because the graph is curved, the motion must be accelerated.</div>

    <li>Describe the motion of the elevator in terms of its position and velocity.</li>
    <div class="Answer">The elevator is at rest (graph is horizontal) initially. It gains speed (graph becomes steeper) for the first 5.0 seconds, at which time it has moved 25.0 metres. It then begins to slow down (graph becomes less steep), coming to a stop after 10.0 seconds, having moved a total displacement of 50.0 metres.</div>

    <li>At what time did the elevator have the greatest instantaneous velocity? How do you know?</li>
    <div class="Answer">The graph is steepest at 5.0 seconds.</div>

    <li>Calculate the instantaneous velocity at the point you identified as having the greatest velocity.</li>
    <div class="Answer">We can estimate the instantaneous velocity by calculating the slope between a point immediately before (4.5 s, 20 m) and immediately after (5.5 s, 30 m) the 5.0-second mark:
        $$\vec{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{\Delta \vec{\mathbf{d}}}{\Delta t}
        = \mathrm{\frac{30\ m - 20\ m}{5.5\ s - 4.5\ s} = +10.0\ m/s}$$</div>

    <li>Calculate the average velocity of the elevator for the entire 10 seconds. Compare your answer for (d). Do these answers make sense? Explain.</li>
    <div class="Answer">$$\vec{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{\Delta \vec{\mathbf{d}}}{\Delta t}
        = \mathrm{\frac{50.0\ m}{10.0\ s} = +5.00\ m/s}$$
        The elevator accelerates from 0 to 10 m/s and then slows back down to 0 m/s. It is reasonable that the average is halfway between 0 and 10 m/s.</div>

<li>The graph below illustrates the velocity (not position!) of a skydiver starting from when she first exits the plane.
<p class="Center">Motion of a Skydiver: \(\vec{\mathbf{v}}\) vs. \(t\)<br/>
    <img alt="Graph" style="width:24em" src="kin/assign/img/skydive.png"/></p>
 <ol type="a">
    <li>Estimate her displacement during each 3-second interval (i.e. from 0 to 3 seconds, from 3 to 6 seconds, etc.) Justify your answers.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
    <p>For the first three seconds, the skydiver accelerates from 0 to –24 m/s for an average of –12 m/s. This gives a displacement of $$\Delta \vec{\mathbf{v}} = \vec{\mathbf{d}}\Delta t = \mathrm{-12\ m/s\cdot 3.0\ s = -36\ m}$$ which is the area of the (approximate) triangle.</p>
    <p>For 3.0 to 6.0 seconds, the skydiver accelerates from –24 m/s to –36 m/s for an average of –30 m/s. This gives a displacement of $$\Delta \vec{\mathbf{v}} = \vec{\mathbf{d}}\Delta t = \mathrm{-30\ m/s\cdot 3.0\ s = -90\ m}$$ which is the area of the (approximate) trapezoid.</p>
    <p>For 6.0 to 9.0 seconds, the skydiver accelerates from –36 m/s to –43 m/s for an average of –39.5 m/s. This gives a displacement of $$\Delta \vec{\mathbf{v}} = \vec{\mathbf{d}}\Delta t = \mathrm{-29.5\ m/s\cdot 3.0\ s = -118.5\ m}$$ which is the area of the (approximate) trapezoid.</p>
    <p>For 9.0 to 12.0 seconds, the skydiver accelerates from –43 m/s to –47 m/s for an average of –45 m/s. This gives a displacement of $$\Delta \vec{\mathbf{v}} = \vec{\mathbf{d}}\Delta t = \mathrm{-45\ m/s\cdot 3.0\ s = -135\ m}$$ which is the area of the (approximate) trapezoid.</p>
    <p>For 12.0 to 15.0 seconds, the skydiver accelerates from –47 m/s to –49 m/s for an average of –48 m/s. This gives a displacement of $$\Delta \vec{\mathbf{v}} = \vec{\mathbf{d}}\Delta t = \mathrm{-48\ m/s\cdot 3.0\ s = -144\ m}$$ which is the area of the (approximate) trapezoid.</p>

    <li>Use your results from (a) to construct a graph of her position versus time.</li>
    <div class="Answer"><p>Remember that the position is the <em>cumulative</em> displacement!</p>

    <li>Calculate the slope of each 3-second interval (i.e. from 0 to 3 seconds, from 3 to 6 seconds, etc.) What do you think this slope represents? Why do you think it changes?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
    <p>Slope is acceleration!</p>
    <p>0 to 3 seconds...$$\mathrm{\frac{-24 m/s - 0.0 m/s}{3.0 s} = -8.0 m/s^2}$$</p>
    <p>3 to 6 seconds...$$\mathrm{\frac{-36 m/s - (-24 m/s)}{3.0 s} = -4.0 m/s^2}$$</p>
    <p>6 to 9 seconds...$$\mathrm{\frac{-43 m/s - (-36 m/s)}{3.0 s} = -2.3 m/s^2}$$</p>
    <p>9 to 12 seconds...$$\mathrm{\frac{-47 m/s - (-43 m/s)}{3.0 s} = -1.3 m/s^2}$$</p>
    <p>12 to 15 seconds...$$\mathrm{\frac{-49 m/s - (-47 m/s)}{3.0 s} = -0.67 m/s^2}$$</p>
