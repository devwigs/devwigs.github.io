<li>A hiker moving in 1D has an initial position of –4.0 km and a final position of +3.2 km relative to some arbitrary origin.
<ol type="a">
   <li>Draw a vector diagram of the hiker’s motion. Label \(\vec{\mathbf d}_i\) (the initial position), \(\vec{\mathbf d}_f\) (the final position), and \(\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}\) (the displacement).
