<h3>Practice</h3>
<ol>
<li>A hiker moving in 1D has an initial position of –4.0 km and a final position of +3.2 km relative to some arbitrary origin.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Draw a vector diagram of the hiker’s motion. Label \(\vec{\mathbf d}_i\) (the initial position), \(\vec{\mathbf d}_f\) (the final position), and \(\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}\) (the displacement).
    <div class="Answer Center"><img src="kin/assign/img/d-1a.png"/></div>
    </li>

    <li>Calculate the hiker’s displacement. Show your work.
    <div class="Answer">$$\Delta\vec{\mathbf d} = \vec{\mathbf d}_f - \vec{\mathbf d}_i = \mathrm{(+3.2 - (-4.0))\ km = +7.2\ km}$$
    </div>
    </li>

    <li>The hiker now walks to a third position of +1.0 km. Draw and label a new vector diagram showing both parts of the motion and the resultant displacement.
    <div class="Answer Center"><img src="kin/assign/img/d-1c.png"/></div>
    </li>

    <li>Calculate the resultant displacement and the total distance the hiker walked.
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>$$\Delta\vec{\mathbf d} = \vec{\mathbf d}_f - \vec{\mathbf d}_i = \mathrm{(+1.0 - (-4.0))\ km = +5.0\ km}$$</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you could calculate the second part of the displacement: \(\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}_2 = \mathrm{(+1.0 - 3.2)\ km = -2.2\ km}\), and then add thtis to the first displacement (\(\mathrm{+7.2\ km}\)) to get the same answer.</p>
    </li> 
</ol>
</li>

<li>A hiker walks 6.00 km north and then 5.00 km east. By drawing an accurate vector diagram of the motion, estimate the magnitude of the hiker’s displacement. Can you think of a way to calculate the magnitude of the displacement?
<div class="Answer">
    <p>Draw an accurate “tip-to-tail” diagram as shown by the red arrows below. The scale of the diagram is 1 square = 0.5 km. The blue arrow is the total displacment.</p>
    <p class="Center"><img src="kin/assign/img/d-2.png"/></p>
    <p>You can measaure the magnitude of the displacment (the length of the blue arrow) using the scale of the diagram, or you can calculate it using the Pythagoras equation.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>A student rides her bicycle 5.00 km north in 12.0 min. After a 5.0 min rest, she rides back south to her starting point in 15.0 min. Determine the student’s displacement and distance traveled for the entire trip.
<div class="Answer">
    <p>The <em>displacment</em> is zero because her final position is the same as her initial position. </p>
    <p class="Center"><img src="kin/assign/img/d-3.png"/></p>
    <p>You can show this by adding the two displacement vectors:
        $$\Delta\vec{\mathbf d} = \Delta\vec{\mathbf d}_1 + \Delta\vec{\mathbf d}_2 = \mathrm{+5.00\ km + (-5.00\ km) = 0.00\ km}$$</p>
    <p><em>Distance</em> is not a vector, so we ignore the direction:
        $$\Delta d = |\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}_1| + |\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}_2| = \mathrm{5.00\ km + 5.00\ km = 10.0\ km}$$</p>
