<section id="eqm"><h3>Equilibrium</h3>
<p>An <em class="Defn">equilibrium</em> is a position where the forces acting on an object balance, so that the acceleration would be zero.</p>
<p>An equilibrium is <em class="Defn">stable</em> when an object <em>close to</em> equilibrium experiences a <em class="Defn">restoring force</em> causing it to accelerate toward the equilibrium position.</p>
<p>Objects <em>close to</em> a stable equilibrium will <em class="Defn">oscillate</em>: move back and forth across the equilibrium.</p>
<p>The time for one complete oscillation, before the motion begins to repeat, is called the <em class="Defn">period</em>, (\(T\)).</p>
<p>The <em>reciprocal</em> of the period is called the <em class="Defn">frequency</em> and is measured in <em>hertz</em> (Hz, oscillations per second): $$f = {1\over T}$$</p>
</section>

<section id="shm"><h3>Simple Harmonic Motion</h3>
<p>Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is a type of oscillation that occurs when the restoring force is <em>directly proportional</em> to the object‚Äôs displacement from equilibrium, \(\vec{\mathbf x}\):
    $$\vec{\mathbf F}_{net} = -k\vec{\mathbf x}$$</p>
<p>When this is the case, graphs of the object‚Äôs position, velocity, and acceleration (all versus time) will all be shaped like a sine or cosine function.</p>
<p class="Center"><img src="../p20/shm/img/shm-0.png" onclick="nextImage(this, event, 3)" alt="SHM"/></p>
<p>All three graphs have the same period.</p>
<p>The starting points (y-intercepts) of the graphs are shifted...</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(\vec{\mathbf v}\) is one-quarter period ‚Äúout of phase‚Äù with \(\vec{\mathbf x}\) because the kinetic energy must be at its maximum when potential energy is at its minimum (and vice versa).</li>
    <li>\(\vec{\mathbf a}\) is one-quarter period out of phase with \(\vec{\mathbf v}\), and one-half period out of phase with \(\vec{\mathbf x}\).</li>
</ul>
<p>The vertical scales of the graphs are all different, but are related:
    $$v_{max} = {2\pi A\over T}$$
    $$a_{max} = {v_{max}^2 \over A} = {4\pi^2 A\over T^2} = {2\pi v_{max}\over T}$$
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The symbol \(A\) is called the <em class="Defn">amplitude</em> and it represents \(x_{max}\), the maximum distance the object moves from its equilibrium.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="shmT"><h3>Period of SHM / Hooke‚Äôs Law</h3>
<p>By substituting the above formulas into Newton‚Äôs 2nd Law, we can obtain an equation for the period:
    $$T = 2\pi\sqrt{m\over k}$$</p>
<p>Hooke‚Äôs Law states that the elastic force exerted by a stretch or compressed object will follow the equation below, <em>within a range</em> of \(\Delta L\) values:
    $$\vec{\mathbf F}_{elas} = -k\Delta L$$</p>
<p>If the elastic force is the only force, or it combines with a constant force such as gravity, the conditions for SHM will be met as long as the elastic remains within its <em>elastic limit</em>.</p>

<section id="ucm"><h3>Uniform Circular Motion</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Uniform circular motion</em> means motion with <u>constant speed</u> along a circular path.</p>
<p>The time for one complete ‚Äúorbit‚Äù is called the <em class="Defn">period</em>, \(T\). Period is related to the speed and radius of the motion:</p>
$$v = {2\pi r \over T}$$
<p>The reciprocal of the period is called the <em class="Defn">frequency</em>. Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz):</p>
$$f = {1\over T}$$
<p>The velocity for UCM is in the <em class="Defn">tangential</em> direction (along the circumference of the circle). Velocity is <b>not</b> constant because its <u>direction</u> is constantly changing.</p>
</section>

<section><h3>Centripetal Acceleration</h3>
<p>Changing direction requires a force (and therefore an acceleration) according to Newton‚Äôs Laws.</p>
<p>For the <u>speed</u> to remain constant, the work done by the force must be exactly zero and the force must be perpendicular to the velocity.</p>
<p>The net force for UCM is directed exactly toward the centre of the circle. This is called the <em class="Defn">centrieptal</em> direction and the acceleration and net force are often called the <em class="Defn">centripetal acceleration</em> and <em class="Defn">centripetal force</em>.</p>
<p>Centripetal acceleration can be calculated as follows:</p>
$$a_c = {v^2 \over r} = {4\pi^2 r\over T^2}$$

<section><h3>Planetary Motion</h3>
<p>Copernicus developed the <em class="Defn">heliocentric model</em> of the Solar System (circular orbits centred around the Sun) to better explain observations like the <em class="Defn">retrograde motion</em> of Mars.</p>
<p>Using Brahe‚Äôs extensive data, Kepler concluded that planetary orbits are actually <u>elliptical</u>. <em class="Defn">Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion</em> are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Orbits are ellipse-shaped with the Sun located at the <u>focus</u> (an off-centre point on the major-axis).</li>
    <li>The areas formed by the Sun and the orbit will always be equal in equal amounts of time.</li>
    <li>There is a mathematical relationship between the mean orbital radius (semi-major axis) and oribtal period:
        $$T^2 = kr^3$$
        $$\left({T_2\over T_1}\right)^2 = \left({r_2\over r_1}\right)^3$$
    </li>
