<p>The <b class="Red">manipulated</b> variable is the quantity that you are intentionally changing during an experiment.
    The <b class="Red">responding</b> variable is the quantity that you are testing, to see how it is affected by the manipulated variable.<p>
<ul>
    <li>All independent variables (ones that <em>could</em> be changed directly) except for the one being manipulated, must be kept constant during an experiment.</li>
    <li>These are called <b class="Red">controlled</b> variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the manipulated and responding variables are both numerical values, you will need to draw a <b class="Red">scatter plot</b> of the data.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The manipulated variable goes on the horizontal (\(x\)) axis. The responding variable goes on the vertical (\(y\)) axis.</li>
    <li>Label both axes with the variable name, symbol, and unit.</li>
    <li>Label the “tick marks” on the axes using a constant interval, chosen to fit all data points while using all available space.</li>
    <li>Give your graph a descriptive title.</li>
    <li>Add a <b class="Red">best-fit line</b> only if the data follows a linear trend; do not use a best-fit line for obviously curved data.</li>
    <li>The best-fit line should pass through the mean (average) of all data points and should minimize the average distance between the line and the data points.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the data is <b class="Red">non-linear</b> and believed to follow a <em>power</em> relationship, you can <b class="Red">transform</b> the data by applying the appropriate power.</p>
<ul>
    <li>For example, if the expected relationship between \(L\) and \(T\) is
        $$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} = 2\pi\frac{L^{\frac{1}{2}}}{g^{\frac{1}{2}}}$$
        you would calculate \(L^{\frac{1}{2}}\) for each data point, and graph the results instead of just \(L\).</li>
    <li>When the variable being transformed appears in the denominator, you must make the exponent negative.</li>
</ul>

<p>Calculate the <b class="Red">slope</b> of your best-fit line by identifying the coordinates of two points that lie on the best-fit line and are far apart: \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Calculate the “rise” between the two points, \(\Delta y = y_2 - y_1\).</li>
    <li>Calculate the “run” between the two points, \(\Delta x = x_2 - x_1\).</li>
    <li>The slope, \(k\), is “rise / run”:$$k = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b class="Red">\(y\)-intercept</b>, \(b\), is the coordinate where the best-fit line crosses the \(y\)-axis.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If \(b\) is not visible on your graph, you can calculate it:$$b = y - kx$$</li>
    <li>\(k\) is the slope of the line.</li>
    <li>\(x\) and \(y\) refer to the coordinates of <em>either</em> of the two points you used to calculate the slope.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your <b class="Red">model equation</b> has the form:$$y = kx+b$$</p>
<ul>
    <li>Replace \(k\) and \(b\) by the calculated values, including units.</li>
    <li>Replace \(x\) and \(y\) by the symbols for the quantites you graphed.</li>
    <li>If you transformed your data to obtain a linear graph, remember to include the exponent...</li>
    <li>For example, replace \(x\) by \(L^{\frac{1}{2}}\) instead of just \(L\) if that is how your transformed the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use your <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_gX0kaqRFXTenBOOTNNNkczZ3M" target="_">TI-83/84 Calculator</a> to
    construct scatter plots and use regression analysis to find a model equation for linear, power, quadratic, and other non-linear type of data.</p>

<p>An experiment typically tests a hypothesis that predicts how changing the manipulated variable affects a responding variable. All other independent variables must be kept constant (controlled) as the data is collected.
To analyze the experimental data, you would typically graph the responding variable (on the y-axis) against the manipulated variable. If the data is linear, add a best-fit line and determine its equation by calculating the slope (k) and the y-intercept (b):
k=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}	y=kx+b
If the data is not linear and you have reason to suspect that there is a power relationship, transform the data by applying the expected exponent and then graph the transformed data. For example, if your data is testing the hypothesis:
g=\frac{GM}{r^2}
you would calculate and graph r^{-2} rather than just r.
You can also use the regression analysis features of a graphing calculator or statistics software to find a model equation. Specify the type of model you want (linear, power, quadratic, exponential, etc.) and the software will determine the equation that best fits the data. Have the software graph the model equation on the scatter plot of the data to see how well it fits.</p>
