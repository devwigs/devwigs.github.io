<h3>Practice</h3>
<ol>
<li>Physics students are given an assignment to design an experiment to study the properties of air. Each student is given an airtight graduated cylinder with a rubber lid that can move in or out.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Amy decides to submerge her cylinder in a large container of ice water, which will remain at 0Â° C until all of the ice melts. She then compresses the air in the cylinder by pushing down on the lid, using a scale to measure the force she exerts. Amy records the volume of air by reading the markings on the graduated cylinder. Identify the variables in this experiment and classify each as manipulated, responding or controlled.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Manipulated: Force (Pressure)<br/>Responding: Volume<br/>Controlled: Temperature; same Graduate Cylinder (Area)
</div>
    <li>A second student, Ben, decides to study how the air expands when heated. He submerges his graduated cylinder of air in a water bath that is gradually being heated. As the temperature rises, Ben observes the rubber lid slowly being pushed up the cylinder. Identify and classify the variables.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Manipulated: Temperature<br/>Responding: Volume<br/>Controlled: Force (Pressure); same Graduate Cylinder (Area)
</div>
</ol></li>

<li>Physics students are investigating the motion of a ball thrown straight up into the air.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Identify and classify the independent and dependent variables that they might measure. Think of as many independent variables as you can, because neglecting even one controlled variable will invalidate the experiment!</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Independent: Mass, Radius, Material, Gravity, Initial Speed, Initial Angle, Initial Height, Time</p>
        <p>Dependent: Hang Time, Height, Distance, Speed, Angle</p>
</div>
    <li>Suggest two hypotheses as to how the variables might be related.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Many different answers are possible!</div>
</ol></li>

<li>As a student studying to become a veterinarian, you have been asked to design an experiment on the growth of puppies into adult dogs.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Identify and classify all relevant independent and dependent variables.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Independent: Breed, Age, Diet (Amount, Type), Exercise, Health Conditions</p>
        <p>Dependent: Mass, Height, Length</p>
    </div>
    <li>Suggest two hypotheses for how the variables might be related.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Many different answers are possible!</div>
</ol></li>

<h3>Vocabulary</h3>
<ul>
    <li>variable: <span class="Answer">Anything that can (in principle) be measured as part of an experiment</span></li>

    <li>independent: <span class="Answer">Variables that the experimenter can specify directly in advance of doing the experiment</span></li>

    <li>dependent: <span class="Answer">Variables that the experimenter can only change indirectly, by changing the independent variables</span></li>

    <li>manipulated: <span class="Answer">An independent variable that the experimenter deliberately changes</span></li>

    <li>responding: <span class="Answer">The dependent variable that the experiment is studying</span></li>

    <li>controlled:
    <span class="Answer">Independent variables that are deliberately kept constant over the course of the experiment.
        Controlling variables in an experiment is very important! If more than one independent variable is changed, there is no way to determine which of those changes caused the responding variable to change.
    </span></li>

    <li>hypothesis: <span class="Answer">A predicted relationship between the manipulated and responding variables</span></li>
</ul>
