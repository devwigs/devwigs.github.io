    <li>Science 10 students performed an experiment for their “Heat” chapter in which they measured the temperature (\(T\)) of some water as they burned a marshmallow beneath it. They constructed a scatter plot for the temperature as a function of the time (\(t\)) for which the water was heated. They noted that their best-fit line passed through the points (0.0 s, 18 °C) and (20.0 s, 25 °C).

    <li><p>Kelly decided to keep track of his mass over a one-month period to see how his weight-loss plan was proceeding. The data is recorded below.</p>

        <li>Analyze the data by drawing a scatter plot with a best-fit line and calculating the model equation.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p><a target="D1" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/mirqpifwnt">Graph</a></p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept can be read from the graph: \(b\) = 81.1 kg.</p>
<p>Using the points (0 days, 81.1 kg) and (30 days, 78.5 kg), the slope is:
$$k = \frac{m_2 - m_1}{\Delta t} = \mathrm{\frac{(78.5 - 81.1)\ kg}{30\ days} = -0.087\ kg/day}$$
The model equation (i.e. the equation of the best-fit line) is:
$$m = (\mathrm{–0.087\ kg/day})\ t + \mathrm{81.1\ kg}$$</p>
        </div>

        <li>Interpret your results for the slope and the y-intercept. In other words, what do these values tell you about Kelly’s weight-loss progress?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Kelly had a starting mass of 81.1 kg and lost 0.087 kg per day on average.</div>
    
        <li>Estimate how long it should take Kelly to reach his goal of 75.0 kg. What assumptions are you making?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
Rearrange the model equation to isolate \(t\)...
$$m - \mathrm{81.1\ kg} = (\mathrm{–0.087\ kg/day})\ t$$
$$t = \frac{m - \mathrm{81.1\ kg}}{\mathrm{–0.087\ kg/day}}$$
Now evaluate with \(m\) = 75.0 kg...
$$t = \frac{\mathrm{(75.0 - 81.1)\ kg}}{\mathrm{–0.087\ kg/day}} = \mathrm{70\ days}$$
        </div>

        <li>Estimate what Kelly’s mass will be after 60 days. What assumptions are you making? Are these assumptions realistic? Explain.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$m = \mathrm{(–0.087\ kg/day)\ 60\ days + 81.1\ kg = 75.9\ kg}$$
We are assuming that the weight loss continues at the same rate until at least day 60.</div>
