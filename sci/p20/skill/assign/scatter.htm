<h3>Practice</h3>
<ol>
<li>Students at a diving school used a pressure gauge to measure the water pressure at various depths in a lake. They recorded the following data.
<p class="Center"><b>Pressure Under Water:</b><br/>
Pressure vs. Depth</p>
<table class="Auto Center">
    <tr><th>Depth<br/>\(h\) / m</th><th>Pressure<br/>\(P\) / kPa</th></tr>
    <tr><td>0.00</td><td>94.2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1.00</td><td>108.2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2.00</td><td>120.0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3.00</td><td>124.4</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4.00</td><td>139.5</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5.00</td><td>143.8</td></tr>
    <tr><td>6.00</td><td>157.5</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7.00</td><td>163.0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8.00</td><td>175.7</td></tr>
    <tr><td>9.00</td><td>184.8</td></tr>
    <tr><td>10.00</td><td>197.6</td></tr>

    <li>Create a scatter plot of the data on graph paper.</li>
    <li>Add a best-fit line.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Graph at <a target="Desmos" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vknfvjkn75">desmos.com</a></div>
    <li>Calculate the slope of the best-fit line.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Using the points (0.00 m, 96.9 kPa) and (8.00 m, 175.7 kPa) the slope is:
        $$k = \mathrm{\frac{(175.7-96.9)\ kPa}{(8.00 - 0.00)\ m} = 9.85\ kPa/m}$$</div>
    <li>What is the significance of the slope?</li>
    <div class="Answer">A slope of 9.85 kPa/m means that the pressure increases by 9.85 kilopascals for every increase in depth of 1.0 metre.</div>
    <li>Estimate how deep the divers would need to go to encounter water pressure of 300 kPa. Explain how you obtained your answer. Is this an interpolation or extrapolation?</li>
    <div class="Answer">300 kPa is 203.1 kPa more than at a depth of zero (where it is 96.9 kPa), so this would occur at an approximate depth of:
        $$\mathrm{\frac{203.1\ kPa}{9.85\ kPa/m} = 20.6\ m}$$</div>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Students wanted to see if there was a relationship between the number of absences a student has in a class and the student’s grade in the class. They recorded data for 12 students in a Physics 20 class.
<p class="Center"><b>Physics 20 Grades</b>:<br/>
Grade vs. Absences</p>
<table class="Auto Center">
    <tr><th>Absences</th><th>Grade / %</th></tr>
    <tr><td>20</td><td>46</td></tr>
    <tr><td>19</td><td>52</td></tr>
    <tr><td>15</td><td>51</td></tr>
    <tr><td>18</td><td>57</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>67</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>61</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td>71</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>63</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td><td>61</td></tr>
    <tr><td>14</td><td>51</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>71</td></tr>

    <li>Calculate the slope of the best-fit line.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Using the points (5, 64%) and (19, 50%) the slope is:
        $$k = \mathrm{\frac{(50 - 64)\%}{19 - 5} = -1.0\%}$$</div>
    <li>What is the significance of the slope?</li>
    <div class="Answer">This means that based on this data a student’s mark drops by 1.0% for each additional absence.</div>

    <li>Use your best-fit line to estimate the y-intercept of the relationship. What is the significance of this value?</li>
    <div class="Answer">The line crosses the y-axis near 69.5%. This is the expected mark for an average student with zero absences.</div>

    <li>Why are the data points so scattered?</li>
    <div class="Answer">There are many other independent variables besides absences that were not controlled for. This often causes the data to become more scattered than in a properly controlled experiment.</div>
