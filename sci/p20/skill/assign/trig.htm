<li>Students conducting a motion experiment set up a ramp that has a length of 1.50 metres. The ramp is inclined so that the bottom of the ramp is on the floor and the higher end of the ramp is 25.0 cm above the floor.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Calculate the incline of the ramp (angle between the ramp and the floor).
    <div class="Answer">
        <img alt="Ramp" src="../p20/skill/assign/img/ramp.png"/>
        <p>
            $$\sin\theta = \mathrm{\frac{Opp}{Hyp} = \frac{0.250\ m}{1.50\ m} = 0.167}$$
            $$\theta=\sin^{-1} 0.167 = 9.59^\circ$$
        </p>
    </div>
    </li>
    <li>Calculate the “base” of the ramp.
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>
            $$\cos\theta = \mathrm{\frac{Adj}{Hyp}}$$
            $$\mathrm{Adj = Hyp}\cdot\cos\theta = \mathrm{1.50\ m\cdot\cos(9.59^\circ) = 1.48\ m}$$
        </p>
        <p>Alternatively, you could obtain the same answer using Pythagoras:
            $$\mathrm{\sqrt{(1.50\ m)^2 - (0.250\ m)^2} = 1.48\ m}$$</p>

<li>Students made a video recording of a game of billiards. They observed the 8-ball at coordinates (80.0, 65.0) cm when it collided with another ball. The 8-ball later collided with a different ball at coordinates (40.0, 50.0).
<ol type="a">
    <li>Plot and label the 8-ball’s initial and final positions on graph paper. Connect the two points with an arrow.</li>
    <li>Construct a right-angle triangle by drawing a horizontal line from the 8-ball’s initial position and a vertical line from the 8-ball’s final position until the two lines meet at a right angle. Label the lengths of these two “legs” of the triangle.
    <div class="Answer">
        <img alt="8-Ball" src="../p20/skill/assign/img/8ball.png"/>
    </div>
    </li>

    <li>Using trigonometry, calculate the hypotenuse of the triangle (the distance between the 8-ball’s initial and final positions).
    <div class="Answer">Using Pythagoras, the hypotensue is:
        $$\mathrm{\sqrt{(40.0\ cm)^2 + (15.0\ cm)^2} = 42.7\ cm}$$</div>
    </li>

    <li>Using trigonometry, calculate and label all the angles of the triangle.
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>For the angle at the vertex \(F\):
            $$\tan\theta = \mathrm{\frac{15.0\ cm}{40.0\ cm} = 0.375}$$
            $$\theta = \tan^{-1}0.375 = 20.6^\circ$$
        </p>
        <p>The third angle at the vertex \(I\) must be 68.4° because the three angles must add up to 180°.</p>
