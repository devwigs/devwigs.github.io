<section id="cop" data-last="?"><h3>Ptolemy &amp; Copernicus</h3>
<p>Pre-modern scientists such as Ptolemy believed that the Earth was stationary at the centre of the universe.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>The Sun, Moon, stars, and planets orbited around the Earth.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">This belief was based on the observation that there is no sensation of motion while at rest on Earth, and also on theological beliefs.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Models with the Earth at the centre are called <em class="Defn">geocentric</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">One of the major problems with the geocentric model is that it does not adequately explain the observed <em class="Defn">retrograde motion</em> of planets like Mars.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When seen in Earth’s sky, every few years Mars seems to stop in its order, reverse direction for a few months, and then return to its original path.</li>
</ul>
<p data-mark="+">Copernicus constructed a new model with the Sun at the centre of the solar system, with Earth and the other planets orbiting around the Sun in perfect circles.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>This model explains the retrograde motion of Mars as being caused by Earth overtaking Mars as it orbits.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Models with the Sun at the centre are called <em class="Defn">heliocentric</em>.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="kep" data-last="?"><h3>Kepler</h3>
<p>Johannes Kepler used precise telescope observations (made by Tycho Brahe) to conclude that the heliocentric model was generally correct, but that the orbits of the planets were not perfect circles.</p>
<p data-mark="+"><b>Kepler’s 1<sup>st</sup> Law</b>: Planets orbit the Sun along ellipse-shaped trajectories with the Sun located at one of the focus points.<p>
<p data-mark="=" class="Center"><img alt="Image" src="img/kepler.png" class="w20"/></p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>An ellipse is a “stretched” circle.</li>
	<li data-mark="+">The longest “diameter” of an ellipse is called the major axis.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The focus point (Sun) is located on the major axis but is off-centre.</li>
	<li data-mark="+">The point where the orbit crosses the major axis close to the focus is called the <em class="Defn">perihelion</em>. This is the point of the orbit that is closest to the Sun.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The orbit’s furthest point from the Sun is called the <em class="Defn">aphelion</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p data-mark="+"><b>Kepler’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law</b>: The area of the sector formed by the Sun and the planet’s initial and final positions (shaded regions of the diagram) is the same at every point in the orbit for equal amounts of time.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Closer to the perihelion, the planet’s potential energy due to the Sun’s gravity is lower, thus its kinetic energy is greater.</li>
</ul>

<p data-mark="+"><b>Kepler’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law</b>: There is a non-linear relationship between the mean orbital radius (\(r\)) and the period (\(T\)), the time for one complete orbit):
    $$T^2=kr^3$$</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>The constant \(k = \mathrm{1\ yr^2/au^3 = 2.97 \times 10^{−19}\ s^2/m^3}\), is determined by the Sun’s gravity.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The “mean orbital radius” is half the length of the major axis.</li>
	<li data-mark="+">Planets further from the Sun take longer to complete each orbit.</li>
	<li data-mark="+">The period of Earth’s orbit is defined as a terrestrial year (\(\mathrm{yr = 3.16 \times 10^7\ s}\)) and Earth’s mean orbital radius is defined as an astronomical unit (\(\mathrm{au = 1.496 \times 10^{11}\ m}\)).</li>
	<li data-mark="+">The relationship can be expressed alternatively using ratios of the periods and orbits for two different planets:
    $$\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2=\left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)^3$$</li>
</ul>

<p data-mark="+">Kepler’s Laws apply not only to the motion of the planets around the Sun, but also to any situation where the motion of an object is determined solely by the gravity of a single, large, spherical object, such as the motion of the Moon or an artificial satellite around the Earth.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>The value of the constant \(k\) is different for Earth’s gravity (or any other planet or star) than for the Sun’s.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">For orbits around Earth, we use the terms <em class="Defn">perigee</em> and <em class="Defn">apogee</em> instead of perihelion and aphelion.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">For orbits around other stars or planets we can use the general terms <em class="Defn">periapsis</em> and <em class="Defn">apoapsis</em>.
