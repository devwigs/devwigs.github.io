    <li>A satellite orbits the Earth in a circular path. The satellite’s period is 3.98 hours and the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity is 2.45 m/s<sup>2</sup>. (Remember that \(g\) becomes smaller than 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> the further one gets from Earth’s surface.) Calculate the satellite’s speed and the radius of its orbit.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Remember to convert the time to standard units, \(T = \mathrm{3.98\cdot 3600\ s = 14328\ s}\):
$$a_c = \frac{4\pi^2 r}{T^2}$$
$$a_cT^2 = 4\pi^2 r$$
$$r = \frac{a_cT^2}{4\pi^2}
= \mathrm{\frac{2.45\ m/s^2 (14328\ s)^2}{4\pi^2}
= 1.27\times 10^7\ m}$$

$$v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}
= \mathrm{\frac{2\pi (1.27\times 10^7\ m)}{14328\ s} = 5.59\times 10^3\ m/s}$$

        <li>There is a 3.20 g stone lodged in the tread of a bicycle tire. The tire has a 26-inch diameter (1 inch = 2.54 cm). What is the stone’s centripetal acceleration when the bike is being ridden at 27.0 km/h?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$r = \mathrm{26\ in / 2 = 13\ in (0.0254\ m/in) = 0.33\ m}$$
$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}
= \mathrm{\frac{(7.50\ m/s)^2}{0.33\ m}}
= \mathrm{1.7\times 10^2\ m/s^2}$$

        <li>Calculate the net force that the stone experiences.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$F_{net} = ma_c = \mathrm{0.00320\ kg\ (1.7\times 10^2\ m/s^2) = 0.54\ N}$$

    <li>A 183 kg satellite orbits a planet. The satellite experiences a gravitational force of 1.30 × 10<sup>3</sup> N while orbiting with a radius of 7500 km.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Use Newton’s 2nd Law to calculate the satellite’s acceleration.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$a_c = \frac{F_{net}}{m}

        <li>Calculate the satellite’s velocity and orbital period.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$\begin{align}
a_c &= \frac{v^2}{r}

\\\\v &= \frac{2\pi r}{T}
\\\\ vT &= 2\pi r

        <li>Identify the three types of force that act on a car as it turns a corner? Assuming the road is unbanked (horizontal), which of those forces balance?  Which force causes the centripetal acceleration?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Gravity and normal balance; friction is unbalanced.</div>

        <li>A car rounding a circular turn with \(r\) = 250 m can have a maximum centripetal acceleration of 7.00 m/s<sup>2</sup>. What is the maximum speed that the car can have while rounding the turn?</li>

\\\\ &= \mathrm{41.8\ m/s}
\end{align}$$</div>

        <li>What would happen to the car if it attempted the turn at a faster speed?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Its turning radius would become larger than the radius of the road.</div>

        <li>When the road is slippery, the maximum centripetal acceleration is reduced to 2.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>. What is the maximum speed that the car can have while rounding the turn under these slippery conditions?</li>

    <li>A mass spectrometer is a device used to identify isotopes (atoms of the same element that have different masses) present in a sample. Helium atoms are given velocities of 1.70 × 10<sup>3</sup> m/s and are then subjected to a magnetic force of 2.72 × 10<sup>–16</sup> N, which causes them to move in a circle.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the acceleration and radius of motion for normal “helium-4” atoms with a mass of 6.65 × 10<sup>–27</sup> kg.</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$a_c = \frac{F_{net}}{m}
= \mathrm{\frac{2.72\times 10^{016}\ N}{6.65\times 10^{-27}\ kg} = 4.09\times 10^{10}\ m/s^2}$$

$$\begin{align}

    <li><p>A Merry-Go-Round is made from a horizontal platform that rotates around a vertical axis.</p>
        <p class="Center"><img alt="Merry-Go-Round" src="circ/assign/img/merry.png"/></p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Why would it be unsafe to stand on a moving Merry-Go-Round if the platform was covered with ice?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Without friction, there is no unbalanced force capable of causing the centripetal acceleration; passengers would move in a straight line and would fall off the outside of the Merry-Go-Round.</div>

        <li>A daring Physics 20 student decided to brave the icy Merry-Go-Round by tying a bungee cord between her waist and the axis of the ride as illustrated. Explain what purpose the bungee serves.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The elastic force replaces the missing friction to provide the centripetal acceleration.</div>
    
        <li>The 52.0 kg student rode the Merry-Go-Round at a radius of 4.20 m. Her classmates later measured the elastic force of the bungee cord to be 250 N when stretched to this length. Determine the student’s velocity and period while on the Merry-Go-Round.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Algebra is the same as #3b...
$$a_c = \frac{F_{net}}{m} = \mathrm{\frac{250\ N}{52.0\ kg} = 4.81\ m/s^2}$$
$$v = \sqrt{ra_c} = \mathrm{\sqrt{4.20\ m\cdot 4.81\ m/s^2} = 4.49\ m/s}$$
$$T = \frac{2πr}{v} = \mathrm{\frac{2\pi (4.20\ m)}{4.49\ m/s} = 5.87\ s}$$

        <li>If humankind establishes a permanent presence on the Moon, people might use projectile trains to travel between settlements. Such trains would not touch the ground but would orbit slightly above the Moon’s surface. If the Moon’s surface gravity is 1.63 m/s<sup>2</sup> and its radius is 1.74 × 10<sup>6</sup> m, what speed would the train have to have to enter a surface orbit?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Algebra is the same as #3b...
$$v = \sqrt{ra_c} = \mathrm{\sqrt{1.74\times 10^6\ m\cdot 1.63\ m/s^2} = 1.68\times 10^3\ m/s}$$
        </div>
        <li>What speed would such a train need to have to orbit just above the Earth’s surface? What problem would such a train encounter on Earth that would be absent on the Moon?</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$v = \sqrt{ra_c} = \mathrm{\sqrt{6.37\times 10^6\ m\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2} = 7.91\times 10^3\ m/s}$$
        At such a high speed, air resistance on Earth would be extreme. This is not a problem on the Moon because there is no atmosphere. </div>
