    <li>An unidentified object, possibly a comet or dwarf planet, orbits our Sun with a mean orbital radius of 8.32 × 10<sup>12</sup> m. Calculate the object’s orbital period. [Hint: Express the mean orbital radius in au first.]</li>
    <div class="Answer">
$$r = \mathrm{\frac{8.32\times 10^{12}\ m}{1.496\times 10^{11}\ m/au} = 55.6\ au}$$
$$\begin{align}
\\T^2 &= kr^3
\\\\ T &= \sqrt{kr^3}
\\\\ &= \mathrm{\sqrt{1.00\ \frac{yr^2}{au^3}\cdot (55.6\ au)^3}}
\\\\ &= \mathrm{415\ yr}
\end{align}$$

    <li>Scientists planning to launch a research satellite to study the Sun want the satellite to orbit the Sun with a period of 3.00 years.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>At what mean orbital radius does the satellite need to orbit the Sun? Answer in astronomical units and in metres.</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$\begin{align}
T^2 &= kr^3
\\\\ \frac{T^2}{k} &= r^3
\\\\ r &= \left(\frac{T^2}{k}\right)^{1/3}
\\\\ &= \mathrm{\left(\frac{(3.00\ yr)^2}{1.00\ yr^2/au^3}\right)^{1/3}}
\\\\ &= \mathrm{2.08\ au}

        <li>How many times larger than Earth’s orbital radius is this? Explain why the orbital radius is not three times bigger than Earth’s even though the orbital period is exactly three times that of Earth.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The satellite orbits at 2.08 times the orbital radius of Earth (i.e. 2.08 au) even though the period is three times larger than Earth’s.  This is because Kepler’s 3rd Law is non-linear; the orbital period and orbital radius have different exponents in the equation.</div>

    <li>An interstellar spacecraft discovers a planet orbiting a nearby star with an orbital radius of 7.21 × 10<sup>11</sup> m and a period of 206 days.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>What is the “Kepler coefficient” for this star?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$T^2 = kr^3$$
$$k = \frac{T^2}{r^3} = \mathrm{\frac{(206\ d)^2}{(7.21\times 10^{11}\ m)^3} = 1.13\times 10^{-31}\ d^2/m^3}$$
        </div>

        <li>If the spacecraft wants to orbit with a period of 21.0 days, what orbital radius should it enter?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Algebra is the same as #2a...
$$\begin{align}
r &= \left(\frac{T^2}{k}\right)^{1/3}
\\\\ &= \mathrm{\left(\frac{(21.0\ d)^2}{1.13\times 10^{-31}\ d^2/m^3}\right)^{1/3}}

        <li>The Moon orbits around Earth with a radius of 3.84 × 10<sup>8</sup> m and a period of 27.3 days. Use this data to calculate the Kepler coefficient (\(k\)) for objects orbiting Earth.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Algebra is the same as #3a...
$$k = \frac{T^2}{r^3} = \mathrm{\frac{(27.3\ d)^2}{(3.84\times 10^8\ m)^3} = 1.32\times 10^{-23}\ d^2/m^3}$$

        <li>If a satellite were placed in Earth orbit with an orbital radius of 8500 km, what would the period of the satellite’s orbit be?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Algebra is the same as #1...
$$\begin{align}
T &= \sqrt{kr^3}

        <li>A geosynchronous orbit is one in which the orbital period of the satellite is equal to the rotational period of the Earth (24.0 hours or 1.00 day). What would the mean orbital radius of a satellite have to be for the satellite to be in a geosynchronous orbit around Earth?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Algebra is the same as #2a...
$$\begin{align}
r &= \left(\frac{T^2}{k}\right)^{1/3}

    <li>An Apollo command module orbits the Moon at an altitude of 80.0 km. It has an orbital period of 1.93 hours. The Moon itself has a radius of 1740 km.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>What is the radius of the command module’s orbit?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
The radius of the Moon itself is 1740 km. Since the command module orbits 80.0 km above the surface, its orbital radius is:
$$r = \mathrm{1740 km\ + 80.0\ km
= 1820\ km
= 1.820\times 10^6\ m}$$</div>

        <li>What orbital radius would a satellite need to have so that it would orbit the Moon with a period equal to 1.00 Earth day?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)^3$$
$$\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^{2/3} = \frac{r_2}{r_1}$$
$$r_1 \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^{2/3} = r_2$$
$$r_2 = \mathrm{1.82\times 10^6\ m \left(\frac{24.0\ h}{1.93\ h}\right)^{2/3}}
= \mathrm{9.77\times 10^6\ m}$$</div>
