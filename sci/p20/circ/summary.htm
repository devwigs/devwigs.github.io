<p><b class="Red">Uniform Circular Motion</b> is motion along a circular path with a constant speed:
$$v=\frac{2\pi r}{T}$$<p>
<ul>
    <li>The <em>velocity</em> is <em>not</em> constant because the <em>direction</em> is continuously changing.</li>
    <li>UCM occurs when a force acts toward the centre of the circular path to produce a <b class="Red">centripetal acceleration</b>:
        $$a_c=\frac{2\pi v}{T}=\frac{v^2}{r}=\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}$$</li>
    <li>The adjective <em>centripetal</em> means “toward the centre”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Amusement park rides often use circular motion to produce a sensation of increased or decreased <b class="Red">apparent weight</b>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Apparent weight refers to the normal force (or other non-gravity forces) that produce stresses on your body tissues while trying to balance gravity.</li>
    <li>When you are accelerating, the forces will <em>not</em> balance, meaning your apparent weight will not be the same as your actual weight (gravity).</li>
</ul>

<p><b class="Red">Planetary Motion</b> refers to the motion of planets, asteroids, comets, and other objects when orbiting around a single, central object that contains nearly all the mass of the system. The central object’s gravity is the cause of the planetary motion.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Kepler’s 1st Law</b>: Objects move along elliptical orbits with the central mass (e.g. the Sun) at the focus of the ellipse. The focus is located off-centre along the major (long) axis.</li>
    <li><b>Kepler’s 2nd Law</b>: The areas of the “sectors” formed by the orbit and the central object will always be equal in equal amounts of time.</li>
    <li><b>Kepler’s 3rd Law</b>: The orbital period is related to the mean orbital radius (semi-major axis):
    $$T^2=kr^3$$
    $$\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2=\left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)^3$$</li>
    <li>Earth’s mean orbital radius is defined as one <b class="Red">astronomical unit</b> (au).</li>
    <li>It may be convenient to use au and years as units because, for Earth orbiting the Sun, both variables are equal to exactly 1.00.</li>
</ul>
