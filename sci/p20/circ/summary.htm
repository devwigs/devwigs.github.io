<p><b class="Red">Uniform Circular Motion</b> is motion along a circular path with a constant speed:
$$v=\frac{2\pi r}{T}$$<p>
<ul>
    <li>The <em>velocity</em> is <em>not</em> constant because the <em>direction</em> is continuously changing.</li>
    <li>UCM occurs when a force acts toward the centre of the circular path to produce a <b class="Red">centripetal acceleration</b>:
        $$a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}=\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}=\frac{2\pi v}{T}$$</li>
    <li>The adjective <em>centripetal</em> means “toward the centre”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Amusement park rides often use circular motion to produce a sensation of increased or decreased <b class="Red">apparent weight</b>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Apparent weight refers to the normal force (or other non-gravity forces) that produce stresses on your body tissues while trying to balance gravity.</li>
    <li>When you are accelerating, the forces will <em>not</em> balance, meaning your apparent weight will not be the same as your actual weight (gravity).</li>
</ul>

<p><b class="Red">Planetary Motion</b> refers to the motion of planets, asteroids, comets, and other objects when orbiting around a single, central object that contains nearly all the mass of the system. The central object’s gravity is the cause of the planetary motion.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Kepler’s 1st Law</b>: Objects move along <b class="Red">elliptical orbits</b> with the central mass (e.g. the Sun) at the <b class="Red">focus</b> of the ellipse. The focus is located off-centre along the major (long) axis.</li>
    <li><b>Kepler’s 2nd Law</b>: The areas of the “sectors” formed by the orbit and the central object will always be equal in equal amounts of time.</li>
    <li><b>Kepler’s 3rd Law</b>: The orbital period is related to the mean orbital radius (semi-major axis):
    $$T^2=kr^3$$
    $$\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2=\left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)^3$$</li>
    <li>Earth’s mean orbital radius is defined as one <b class="Red">astronomical unit</b> (au).</li>
    <li>It may be convenient to use au and years as units because, for Earth orbiting the Sun, both variables are equal to exactly 1.00.</li>
</ul>

<p>For <b class="Red">circular orbits</b> around a star or planet, we can set the acceleration of the orbiting object equal to the source’s gravitational field:
    $$a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{4\pi^2 r}{T^2} = g = \frac{GM}{r^2} $$</p>
<ul>
    <li>This is only true when there are no other forces, including thrust, air resistance, and gravity due to other sources.</li>
    <li>A <b class="Red">geosynchronous</b> orbit has a period equal to the planet’s rotation.</li>
    <li>A <b class="Red">geostationary</b> orbit is a circular, geosynchronous orbit above the planet’s equator; the satellite maintains a fixed position relative to the ground.</li>
    <li>Geostationary satellites are useful for communication, because ground-based receivers (satellite dishes) will not need to track the satellite’s motion unless the receiver is moved.</li>
</ul>
