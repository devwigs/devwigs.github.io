<p><b class="Red">Vectors</b> are quantities that involve a direction, such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We can illustrate vectors using a <b class="Red">vector diagram</b>, in which each vector is drawn as an arrow illustrating the direction and the magnitude (size) of the vector.</li>
    <li>To illustrate the addition of two or more vectors, the vectors are drawn in a <em>tip-to-tail</em> fashion.</li>
</ul>

<p><b class="Red">Cartesian Form</b> means that a 2D vector is described as separate \(x\)- and \(y\)-<b class="Red">components</b>; \(\Delta \vec{\mathbf d}_1 = \mathrm{(5.0, 8.7)\ m}\).</p>
<p><b class="Red">Polar Form</b> describes a vector by its <b class="Red">magnitude</b> and its <b class="Red">direction</b>; \(\Delta \vec{\mathbf d}_1 = \mathrm{10\ m\ [60°]}\).</p>
<ul>
    <li>The direction is an angle measured <em>counter-clockwise</em> from the \(+\)x-direction.</li>
    <li>We can convert a vector from polar to Cartesian form:
        $${\vec{\mathbf{v}}}_x=\left|\vec{\mathbf{v}}\right|\cos{\theta}$$
        $${\vec{\mathbf{v}}}_y=\left|\vec{\mathbf{v}}\right|\sin{\theta}$$</li>
    <li>We can also convert a vector from Cartesian to polar form:
        $$\left|\vec{\mathbf{v}}\right|=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}$$
        $$\tan{\theta}=\frac{{\vec{\mathbf{v}}}_y}{{\vec{\mathbf{v}}}_x}$$</li>
    <li>To isolate \(\theta\), you need to apply \(\tan^{–1}\) to the last equation; this will give only one of two possible answers.</li>
    <li>If the \(x\)-component of a vector is negative (if the vector points into the second or third quadrant), you will need to add 180° to find the second (correct) solution for \(\theta\).</li>
    <li>When performing arithmetic or algebra involving vector quantities, treat the \(x\)- and \(y\)-components independently; perform your calculations on the \(x\)-components alone, and then on the \(y\)-components alone.
        (Some problems may require you to solve the \(y\)-component first.)</li>
    <li>Alternatively, some 2D vector problems can be solved by applying trigonometric relationships to the vector diagram.</li>
    <li>Remember that the Pythagoras equation and “SOH CAH TOA” apply only to triangles containing a right angle. For triangles that don’t (or may not) have a 90° angle, you can use the Law of Cosines and Law of Sines instead.</li>
</ul>

<p><b class="Red">Projectile Motion</b> is the 2D version of uniform accelerated motion.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gravity causes a constant acceleration in the \(-y\) direction; thus we can use the UAM equations to solve for the \(y\)-components of the kinematics vectors.</li>
    <li>There are no forces in the \(x\)-direction, so the \(x\)-motion is simply uniform motion (constant velocity).</li>
    <li>The <b class="Red">hang time</b> means the total time it takes the projectile to first land on the ground.</li>
    <li>The <b class="Red">range</b> means the hortizontal displacment of the projectile when it first lands on the ground.</li>
</ul>
