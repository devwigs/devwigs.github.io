    <li>A student undergoes a displacement from position \({\vec{\mathbf{d}}}_i\) = (+3.0, –2.0) m to \({\vec{\mathbf{d}}}_f\) = (+1.0, +2.0) m.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Illustrate the student’s motion by plotting their initial and final positions and drawing the displacement vector as an arrow. Indicate the scale of the diagram and be sure to use the same scale on both axes.</li>
        <li>Use a protractor to measure the direction of the student’s displacement.</li>
        <li>Use a ruler to measure the magnitude of the student’s displacement. Be sure to account for the scale of the diagram.</li>
    </ol></li>

    <li>A passenger in a car uses the GPS in their smartphone to measure the car’s velocity as 80.0 km/h with a direction of W 32.0° N.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Use a ruler and protractor to draw an illustration of the velocity vector. Indicate the scale of the diagram and use the same scale on both axes. Draw the velocity vector with its tail at the origin.</li>
        <li>Record the coordinates of the vector’s tip.</li>
    </ol></li>

    <li>A spacecraft experiences a force of 15.0 kilonewtons at a direction of –65.0° due to the thrust of its rockets.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Draw an illustration of the force vector with its tail at the origin.</li>
        <li>Record the coordinates of the force vector’s tip.</li>
    </ol></li>

    <li>A field lacrosse player runs 25.0 metres [45.0°] to retrieve the ball, and then turns and runs another 35.0 metres [192°] to get into position to take a shot.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Draw an illustration of the player’s motion by drawing the two displacement vectors in a tip-to-tail fashion. You can take the player’s initial position as the origin. It is strongly recommended that you draw a “rough sketch” on scrap paper first, to help you decide on an appropriate scale for your “good” drawing.</li>
        <li>Record the coordinates of the player’s final position.</li>
        <li>Draw the player’s resultant vector (a displacement vector from their initial to their final position that ignores the actual path that they followed) on the vector diagram above.</li>
        <li>Use a ruler and protractor to measure the magnitude and direction if the lacrosse player’s resultant displacement. Be sure to account for the scale of the diagram.</li>
    </ol></li>

    <li>A ball rolling down a hill experiences two forces: the gravity force is \({\vec{\mathbf{F}}}_g\) = 3.50 newtons [–90.0°] and the “normal force” (the force of the ground pushing on the ball) is \({\vec{\mathbf{F}}}_n\) = 3.40 newtons [+76.0°].
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Determine the resultant force by drawing the two forces in a tip-to-tail fashion. Draw the resultant force vector (preferably in a different colour) as well as the two forces being added.</li>
        <li>Record the coordinates of the tip of the resultant force vector.</li>
        <li>Measure the magnitude and direction of the resultant force.</li>
