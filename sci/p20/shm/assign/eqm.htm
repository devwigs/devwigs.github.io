    <li>A simple pendulum is constructed by hanging a mass from a string and attaching the other end of the string to a fixed location. If we can neglect air resistance, the motion of the mass will be determined by the gravity and tension forces.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Draw a free body diagram for the mass when it is at its equilibrium position. Explain how you know this position is the equilibrium.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Because the gravity force is vertically down, equilibrium occurs when the tension force is directly up.</p>

        </div>
    
        <li>Determine whether the equilibrium is stable or unstable. To do this, draw a free body diagram for the mass close to equilibrium, and determine whether the net force is directed toward or away from the equilibrium.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Stable. When the mass is to the left of equilibrium, the tension force will be angled to the right. The net force will be a restoring force directed back toward the equilibrium.</p>

        </div>
    
        <li>Comment on the statement: “The mass has the least potential energy when it is passing through its equilibrium position.”</li>
        <div class="Answer">This is true for the pendulum because the equilibrium is the lowest point of the motion so the gravitational potential energy (mgh) is at a minimum.</div>

    <li>A mass hanging from a spring oscillates up and down as shown in the graph below. The graph uses an arbitrary origin.
        <p class="Center"><img src="p20/shm/assign/img/shm1.png" alt="Motion Graph"/></p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Use the graph to determine the (i) equilibrium position, (ii) period, and (iii) amplitude of the motion. Show your calculations.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p>Equilibrium: $$\vec{\mathbf d}_{eq} = \mathrm{\frac{-0.15\ cm + 0.45\ cm}{2} = +0.15\ cm}$$</p>
<p>Amplitude: $$A = \mathrm{0.45\ cm - 0.15\ cm = 0.30\ cm}$$</p>
<p>Period: $$T = \mathrm{1.5\ s}$$</p>
        </div>
    
        <li>Calculate the frequency of the motion.</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$f = \frac{1}{T} = \mathrm{\frac{1}{1.5\ s} = 0.67\ Hz}$$</div>
    
        <li>Mark a point on the graph where the object is passing through its equilibrium. Draw a tangent line to the graph through this point. Would you agree that this line is steeper than any other place on the graph? Use the concept of energy conservation to explain why the object should have the greatest speed while it is passing through equilibrium.</li>
        <div class="Answer">If equilibrium is the point where the potential energy is least, this should be where the kinetic energy is greatest.</div>

        <li>Calculate the slope of the tangent line.</li>    
        <li>Calculus predicts that for sinusoidal functions, the amplitude, period, and equilibrium (maximum) speed are related by the equation:
$$v_{max}=\frac{2\pi A}{T}$$
Confirm that this relationship correctly predicts the slope you calculated in (d).</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$v_{max} = \frac{2\pi A}{T} = \mathrm{\frac{2\pi\cdot 0.30\ cm}{1.5\ s} = 1.26\ cm/s}$$
        </div>
    </ol></li>

    <li>A bass guitar player plays a note with a frequency of 40 Hz. The bass is connected to an amplifier which causes a loudspeaker to oscillate at this frequency and with an amplitude of 2.0 mm.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the period of the oscillations.</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$T = \frac{1}{f} = \mathrm{\frac{1}{40\ Hz} = 0.025\ s}$$</div>

        <li>Draw a graph of the oscillations (the motion of the moving parts within the loudspeaker) for two complete periods.</li>
