    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the period of a 1.00 m long simple pendulum when \(g\) = 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} = \mathrm{2\pi\sqrt{\frac{1.00\ m}{9.81\ m/s^2}} = 2.01\ s}$$
        </div>

        <li>If the same pendulum were used on a planet with \(g\) = 1.70 m/s<sup>2</sup>, what would its period be?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} = \mathrm{2\pi\sqrt{\frac{1.00\ m}{1.70\ m/s^2}} = 4.82\ s}$$
        </div>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>What length would a simple pendulum have to be to have a period of 5.00 s on Earth?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$
$$T^2 = 4\pi^2\frac{L}{g}$$
$$gT^2 = 4\pi^2 L$$
$$L = \frac{gT^2}{4\pi^2} = \mathrm{\frac{9.81\ m/s^2\cdot (5.00\ s)^2}{4\pi^2} = 6.21\ m}$$
        </div>

        <li>What would the period of the pendulum become if you doubled its length? [Hint: The period does not double.]</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} = \mathrm{2\pi\sqrt{\frac{12.42\ m}{9.81\ m/s^2}} = 7.07\ s}$$
When the length doubles, the period increases by a factor of \(\sqrt{2}\) because of the square root operation in the equation!

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Astronauts landing on a newly discovered planet find that an 80.0 cm long simple pendulum has a period of 1.75 s. What is the planet’s gravitational field strength?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$
$$T^2 = 4\pi^2\frac{L}{g}$$
$$gT^2 = 4\pi^2 L$$
$$g = \frac{4\pi^2L}{T^2} = \mathrm{\frac{4\pi^2\cdot 0.800\ m}{(1.75\ s)^2} = 10.3\ m/s^2}$$
        </div>

        <li>Suppose the pendulum has an amplitude of 2.00 cm and a mass of 454 grams. Calculate the mechanical energy of the pendulum.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
The easier method is to calculate \(v_{max}\) which is the speed at equilibrium when \(E_p\) is zero...
$$v_{max} = \frac{2\pi A}{T} = \mathrm{\frac{2\pi\cdot 0.0200\ m}{1.75\ s} = 0.718\ m/s}$$
$$E = \frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2}(0.454\ kg) (0.718\ m/s)^2 = 0.00117\ J}$$
You could also find \(k\) by rearranging \(T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\), and then calculating the potential energy when \(\vec{\mathbf x}\) = 2.00 cm, since the kinetic energy would be 0.

    <li>A grandfather clock uses a 65.0 cm long simple pendulum as a timing device.  
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the pendulum’s period on Earth.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} = \mathrm{2\pi\sqrt{\frac{0.650\ m}{9.81\ m/s^2}} = 1.62\ s}$$
        </div>

        <li>Calculate the pendulum’s period on a planet where g = 5.25 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} = \mathrm{2\pi\sqrt{\frac{0.650\ m}{5.25\ m/s^2}} = 2.21\ s}$$
        </div>

        <li>If the grandfather clock was designed to operate correctly on Earth, would it run fast or slow on the low gravity planet? After 24.0 hours, how many hours would have passed according to the (incorrect) clock?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
The number of swings completed in 24.0 hours (86 400 s) on the planet is:
$$\mathrm{\frac{86400\ s}{2.21\ s} = 39095}$$
Since the clock was designed for Earth, the time it will record is:
$$\mathrm{39095 (1.62\ s) = 63334 s = 17.6 h}$$
The clock is running slow!

    <li>Show that for a simple pendulum, the equation for potential energy of SHM gives approximately the same result as the gravitational potential energy equation (\(E_g=mgh\)) when \(h\) is measured relative to equilibrium. While it is difficult to prove this in general, it is easier to show for a specific length and angle, e.g. \(L\) = 1.00 m and \(\theta\) = 15.0°</li>
    <div class="Answer">
<p class="Center"><img alt="Pendulum" src="p20/shm/assign/img/pend_trig.png"/></p>
<p>Use trig to calculate the height at 15.0°...
$$h = L - L\cos\theta = \mathrm{1.00\ m - 1.00\ m\cdot \cos 15.0^\circ = 0.0341 m}$$
Calculate the “exact” energy (per kilogram)...
$$E_g = mgh$$
$$\frac{E_g}{m} = gh = \mathrm{9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 0.0341\ m = 0.334\ J/kg}$$
The actual distance from equilibrium, measured along the circular arc (shown in blue on the diagram) is 15/360 of a complete circle, which would have a circumference of \(2\pi L\)...
$$x = 2\pi L \frac{15}{360} = \mathrm{2\pi\cdot 1.00\ m \frac{15}{360} = 0.262\ m}$$
Measured in a straight line (the red segment) this length would be \(x_0 = \mathrm{1.00\ m\cdot\sin 15.0^\circ = 0.259\ m}\).
$$E_p = \frac{1}{2} kx^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{mg}{L}\right) x^2 = \frac{mgx^2}{2L}$$
$$\frac{E_p}{m} = \frac{gx^2}{2L}
    = \mathrm{\frac{9.81\ m/s^2\cdot(0.262\ m)^2}{2\cdot 1.00\ m}}
    = \mathrm{0.336\ J/kg}$$</p>
