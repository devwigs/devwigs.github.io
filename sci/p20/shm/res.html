<p>A child on a swing behaves like a simple pendulum, with its own frequency and period given by the equation:
$$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$</p>
<p data-mark="+">To push the child on a swing, you must push with the same frequency as the pendulum to ensure that you are always pushing forward and causing the child to gain energy:
$$\Delta E=\vec{\mathbf{F}}\cdot\Delta\vec{\mathbf{d}}$$</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Imagine a poorly programmed robot pushing the child at completely random times.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">It would be just as likely that the force would be in the wrong direction, causing the child to lose energy as to gain.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When a force acts on a system with the same frequency as the system’s natural frequency of oscillation, scientists call this <em class="Defn">mechanical resonance</em>.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The system’s natural frequency is also called the <em class="Defn">resonant frequency</em>.</li>
</ul>

<section id="a" data-last="?"><h3>Applications</h3>
<p data-mark="+">Mechanical resonance means that a force acting at a resonant frequency will add energy to the system, causing the amplitude to grow over time.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>One important application of mechanical resonance is in designing buildings that can withstand earthquakes.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Buildings tend to sway with a resonant frequency.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When an earthquake causes the ground to shake at the building’s resonant frequency, the building is at risk of collapse.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Engineers can design features that can alter the resonant frequency and/or “damp” the oscillations to reduce the risk of collapse.</li>
</ul>
