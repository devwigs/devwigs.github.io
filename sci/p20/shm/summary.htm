<p><b class="Red">Simple harmonic motion</b> (SHM) is a type of <b class="Red">oscillation</b>; a back-and-forth motion centred at the object’s <b class="Red">equilibrium</b>.
<ul>
    <li>SHM is <em>caused</em> by a <b class="Red">restoring force</b> that is <em>proportional</em> to how far the object is from its equilibium (\(\vec{\mathbf x}\)); the farther from equilibrium the stronger the net force:
        $$\vec{\mathbf F}_{net} = -k\vec{\mathbf x}$$</li>
    <li>The potential energy associated with the restoring force is$$E_p = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$</li>
</ul>

<p>SHM produces a graph of position versus time that can be described mathematically by a \(\sin\) or \(\cos\) function.</p>
<p class="Center"><img src="shm/img/shm-0.png" alt="d-t Graph"/></p>
<ul>
    <li>The <b class="Red">amplitude</b>, \(A\), is the maximum distance from equilibrium.</li>
    <li>The <b class="Red">period</b> of SHM is the time for one complete oscillation or cycle of the motion.
        $$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$</li>
    <li>The reciprocal of the period is called the <b class="Red">frequency</b> and is measured in hertz (1 Hz = 60 rpm).
        $$f = \frac{1}{T}$$</li>
    <li>The maximum velocity (the steepest part of the graph) occurs when the object passes through equilibrium.
        $$v_{max} = \frac{2\pi A}{T}$$</li>
    <li>A graph of the object’s velocity has the same shape and period as its position, but the graph is shifted one-quarter of a period.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><img src="shm/img/shm-1.png" alt="v-t Graph"/></p>
<ul>
    <li>The velocity and position are “out of sync” because it has the greatest speed (most \(E_k\)) when it is closest to equilibirum (least \(E_p\)).</li>
    <li>A graph of the object’s acceleration is shifted another quarter of a period.
        $$a_{max} = \frac{v_{max}^2}{A} = \frac{4\pi^2 A}{T^2}$$</li>
    </ul>

<p>The motion of a <b class="Red">simple pendulum</b> is <em>approximately</em> SHM when the angle of the swing is less than about 30°.
    $$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$</p>
<ul><li>For larger angles the restoring force is not in direct proportion to the distance from equilibrium, due to the curved trajectory of the object.</li></ul>

<p><b class="Red">Mechanical resonance</b> is the tendancy of the amplitude to grow very large when an oscillator is “driven” at its harmonic or resonant frequency.</p>
<ul>
    <li>This happens because when the driving force is properly “synced” with the oscillations, it will always do a positive amount of work.</li>
    <li>Mechanical resonance has important implications for designing buildings and other structures that can withstand earthquakes.</li>
</ul>
