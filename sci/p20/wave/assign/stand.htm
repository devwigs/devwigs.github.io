        <li>An open air column has a third harmonic of 900 Hz. What is the length of the air column? </li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$f = \frac{nv}{2L}$$
$$fL = \frac{nv}{2}$$
$$L = \frac{nv}{2f} = \mathrm{\frac{3\cdot 343\ m/s}{2\cdot 900\ Hz} = 0.572\ m}$$
        </div>
    
        <li>A closed air column has a third harmonic of 900 Hz. What is the length of the air column?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$f = \frac{nv}{4L}$$
$$fL = \frac{nv}{4}$$
$$L = \frac{nv}{4f} = \mathrm{\frac{3\cdot 343\ m/s}{4\cdot 900\ Hz} = 0.286\ m}$$

    <li>The highest frequency of sound wave that the human ear can hear is around 20.0 kHz. Determine the length of a closed air column that would produce this frequency as its (i) fundamental or (ii) third harmonic.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
For fundamental (\(n\) = 1)...
$$L = \frac{nv}{4f} = \mathrm{\frac{1\cdot 343\ m/s}{4\cdot 20000\ Hz} = 4.26\ mm}$$
For \(n\) = 3...
$$L = \frac{nv}{4f} = \mathrm{\frac{3\cdot 343\ m/s}{4\cdot 20000\ Hz} = 1.28\ cm}$$

    <li>A guitar string is 72.0 cm long and produces a fundamental at 520 Hz.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the speed of waves in this string. </li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$f = \frac{nv}{2L}$$
$$2Lf = nv$$
$$v = \frac{2Lf}{n} = \mathrm{\frac{2\cdot 0.720\ m\cdot 520\ Hz}{1} = 749\ m/s}$$

        <div class="Answer">
$$f_1 = \frac{v}{2L} = \mathrm{\frac{902\ m/s}{2\cdot 0.720\ m} = 626\ Hz}$$

    <li>A footbridge constructed of rope and wood can produce waves like a string does.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>If a bridge is 22.4 m long, and the speed of waves is 3.50 m/s, what is the fundamental frequency?</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$f_1 = \frac{v}{2L} = \mathrm{\frac{3.50\ m/s}{2\cdot 22.4\ m} = 0.0781\ Hz}$$</div>

        <li>What is the frequency of the fifth harmonic?</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$f_5 = \mathrm{5\cdot 0.0781\ Hz = 0.391\ Hz}$$</div>

        <li>What would happen if a group of people (e.g. a military unit or a marching band) crossed the bridge while marching in step with a period equal to the fifth harmonic?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Resonance! The marchers will be adding energy to the wave so the amplitude will increase.</div>

    <li>An air column that is 21.0 cm long produces a resonance with sound waves at 1.21 kHz. Students adjust the frequency of the waves and find the next resonance at 2.01 kHz.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Is the air column open or closed? [Hint: Are the resonant frequencies exact multiple of the difference between them?] </li>    
        <li>Identify the harmonics (i.e. the values of n) that these two frequencies represent. [Hint: First determine what the fundamental frequency must be.]</li>
        <div class="Answer">
The difference between the frequencies is 0.80 kHz. If the air column was open (\(n\) = 1, 2, 3...) this would be the fundamental frequency, but 1.21 and 2.01 kHz are not multiples of 0.80 kHz.
The air column must be closed (\(n\) = 1, 3, 5...) so that the difference is <em>twice</em> the fundamental frequency. I.e. \(f_1\) = 0.40 kHz so that \(f_3\) = 1.21 kHz and \(f_5\) = 2.01 kHz.

        <li>Calculate the speed of sound based on the information provided.</li>
        <div class="Answer">

$$v = \frac{4Lf}{n} = \mathrm{\frac{4\cdot 0.210\ m\cdot 2010\ Hz}{5} = 338\ m/s}$$
