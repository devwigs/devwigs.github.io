    <li>Two pulses (waves of short duration) are moving towards each other from opposite ends of a string. One pulse is triangular shaped and the other is rectangular. Both have widths of 20 cm and heights of 10 cm.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Use the Principle of Superposition to draw the combined wave at the instant when they completely overlap. Is the interference constructive or destructive?</li>
        <li>Repeat (a) when the rectangular wave is negative (below equilibrium).</li>

        <li>A tuning fork vibrating at 440 Hz is used to tune a piano. When the piano note is played, a beat frequency of 3.0 Hz is heard. When the piano string is tightened the frequency increases and the beat frequency becomes 4.0 Hz. What was the piano note’s frequency before and after tightening?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$f_{beat} = |f_1 - f_2|$$
$$\pm f_{beat} = f_1 - f_2$$
$$f_1 = f_2 \pm f_{beat}$$
Before the string is tightened...
$$f_1 = \mathrm{440\ Hz \pm 3.0\ Hz = 443\ Hz\ or\ 437\ Hz}$$
After the string is tightened...
$$f_1 = \mathrm{440\ Hz \pm 4.0\ Hz = 444\ Hz\ or\ 436\ Hz}$$

        <li>Should the musician continue tightening the string or loosen it? How will he or she know when the string is properly tuned?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Since we know the piano string frequency increased, the correct answers are 443 Hz (before) and 444 Hz (after).</div>

        <li>What beat frequency would be observed is two surface waves on water having frequencies of 5.0 Hz and 6.0 Hz interfere?</li>
        <div class="Answer">$$f_{beat} = |f_1 - f_2| = \mathrm{|6.0\ Hz - 5.0\ Hz| = 1.0\ Hz}$$</div>

        <li>If the two waves described above are in phase at the observer’s location at \(t\) = 0, at what times during the first 2.0 seconds will completely constructive interference occur? At what times will completely destructive interference occur? You can use the graph at the following location to help answer: <a href="https://desmos.com/calculator/kllohmaftu">Graph</a>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$T_{beat} = \frac{1}{f_{beat}} = \mathrm{\frac{1}{1.0\ Hz} = 1.0 s}$$
Constructive interference would occur every 1.00 seconds; i.e. at \(t\) = 0.0, 1.0 and 2.0 s. Destructive interference would occur midway between each of these times: \(t\) = 0.50, and 1.50 s.

        <li>Sketch a graph of the wave produced by these two interfering harmonic waves.</li>

        <li>Repeat (a)-(c) for a 5.0 Hz and an 8.0 Hz wave.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$f_{beat} = |f_1 - f_2| = \mathrm{|8.0\ Hz - 5.0\ Hz| = 3.0\ Hz}$$
$$T_{beat} = \frac{1}{f_{beat}} = \mathrm{\frac{1}{3.0\ Hz} = 0.33 s}$$
Constructive interference would occur every one-third of a second; i.e. at t = 0.00, 0.33, 0.67, 1.00, 1.33, 1.67 and 2.00 s. Destructive interference would occur midway between each of these times: t = 0.17, 0.50, 0.83, 1.17, 1.50 and 1.83 s.

    <li>As a cyclist is riding toward her friend, both the cyclist and the stationary friend strike identical 480 Hz tuning forks. If they hear 5.0 beats per second, how fast is the cyclist riding?
    <div class="Answer">
The beat pattern occurs because the Doppler Effect causes the observer to hear the sound from the moving source at a higher frequency when the source is moving toward the observer.
For a 5.0 Hz beat frequency, \(f_o\) = 480 Hz + 5.0 Hz = 485 Hz. The Doppler formula can be simplified for \(v_o\) = 0:
$$f_o = \frac{v - v_o}{v - v_s}\  f_s = \frac{v}{v - v_s}\ f_s$$
$$f_o (v - v_s) = v f_s$$
$$v - v_s = \frac{v f_s}{f_o}$$
$$-v_s = \frac{v f_s}{f_o} - v$$
$$v_s = -\frac{v f_s}{f_o} + v
    = \mathrm{-\frac{343\ m/s\cdot 480\ Hz}{485\ Hz} + 343\ m/s = 3.54\ m/s}$$
