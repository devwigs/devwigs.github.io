<p>A <b class="Red">mechanical wave</b> is a <em>disturbance</em> that <em>transports energy</em> through a <em>medium</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>According to mathematician Joseph Fourier, any wave can be treated as one or more harmonic (sine-shaped) waves that have been added together.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><img style="width:512px" src="wave/img/wave_tr.png" alt="Transverse"/></p>
<ul>
    <li>For <b class="Red">transverse</b> waves (e.g. light*, waves on a string), the motion of the individual points along the wave is <em>perpendicular</em> to the motion of the wave’s energy (<b class="Red">phase velocity</b>).</li>
    <li>*Light is an electromagnetic wave (see Physics 30!) not a mechanical wave; it does not require a medium.</li>
    <li>Points “above” equilibrium are called <b class="Red">crests</b> and points “below” equilibrium are <b class="Red">troughs</b>.</li>
    <li>For <b class="Red">longitudinal</b> waves (e.g. sound) the particle motion is <em>parallel</em> to the phase velocity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><img style="width:512px" src="wave/img/wave_lt.png" alt="Longitudinal"/></p>
<ul>
    <li><b class="Red">Compressions</b> occur where the particles are closer together than normal and <b class="Red">rarefactions</b> are when the particles are more spread out.</li>
    <li>Some waves (e.g. surface waves on water) have <em>both</em> transverse and longitudinal components.</li>
    <li>The distance between corresponding points on adjacent waves (e.g. crest-to-crest) is called the <b class="Red">wavelength</b>, \(\lambda\).</li>
    <li>Harmonic waves also have an amplitude, period, and frequency, which have the same meaning as for SHM.</li>
    <li>The phase speed of a wave can be calculated as: $$v=\frac{\lambda}{T}=f\lambda$$</li>
</ul>

<p><b class="Red">Doppler Effect</b> is a phenomenon where the observed frequency of waves is different than the actual frequency of the source when the source and observer are in relative motion:
$$f_o=\frac{v-v_o}{v-v_s}f_s$$</p>
<p class="Center"><img style="width:360px" src="wave/img/dopp1.png" alt="Doppler"/></p>
<ul>
    <li>Waves are closer together — the observed frequency is higher — when the source is approaching the observer.</li>
    <li>Waves are farther apart — the observed frequency is lower — when the source is receding from the observer.</li>
</ul>

<p><b class="Red">Interference</b> occurs when two waves overlap in the same place at the same time.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b class="Red">Constructive</b> interference means that two similar parts (e.g. two crests) overlap to produce a bigger wave.</li>
    <li><b class="Red">Destructive</b> interference means that two dissimilar parts (e.g. one crest and one trough) overlap to produce a smaller wave.</li>
    <li>A <b class="Red">beat pattern</b> occurs when two waves of slightly different frequency move in and out of phase, resulting in alternating constructive and destructive interference with a beat frequency:
        $$f_{beat}=\left|f_1-f_2\right|$$</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><img src="wave/img/beat.png" alt="Beats"/></p>

<p><b class="Red">Standing Waves</b> are produced when a wave moving on a <em>finite medium</em> interferes with its own reflections.</p>
<ul>
    <li>When the end of the medium is fixed, the interference there must be destructive, and a <b class="Red">node</b> will be produced.</li>
    <li>Only certain harmonics (or resonant frequencies) can have nodes at both ends (e.g. stringed instruments or air columns open at both ends):
        $$f_n=\frac{nv}{2L}$$</li>
    <li>The illustration below shows the third harmonic. (\(n = 3\))</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><img src="wave/img/stand3.png" alt="Standing"/></p>
<ul>
    <li>The first harmonic (\(n = 1\)) is sometimes called the <b class="Red">fundamental</b> frequency.</li>
    <li>At a free end, the interference will be constructive, and an <b class="Red">anti-node</b> will occur.</li>
    <li>When one end is a node and the other an anti-node (e.g. an air column closed at only one end), only <em>odd-numbered</em> harmonics will occur:
        $$f_n=\frac{nv}{4L}$$</li>
</ul>
