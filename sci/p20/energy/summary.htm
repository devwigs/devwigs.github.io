<p><b class="Red">Mechanical energy</b> (measured in joules) includes kinetic, rotational, gravitational potential, and elastic potential energy.
    $$E_k = {1\over 2}mv^2$$
    $$E_g = mgh$$
    $$E_{elas} = {1\over 2}k(\Delta L)^2$$
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The equation for rotational energy depends on the shape (e.g. sphere or cylinder) and mass distribution (e.g. solid or hollow)</li>
    <li>Other (non-mechanical) forms of energy include thermal energy, sound, chemical, nuclear, electrical and electromagnetic energy.</li>
</ul>
<p><b class="Red">Law of Energy Conservation</b>: Energy can be transformed from one form to another, but the <b>total</b> energy always remains constant.
    $$\Sigma E_i = \Sigma E_f$$
</p>
<ul>
    <li>On an energy bar chart, the <em>total</em> of all bars will always be constant.</li>
    <li>Any energy that is going to be <em>added</em> to a system must be included with the <em>initial</em> energy.</li>
    <li>Any energy that is <em>removed</em> from a system must be included with the <em>final</em> energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mechanical energy transformations are caused by <b class="Red">forces</b> (measured in newtons). The <em>amount</em> of energy that a force transforms is called the <b class="Red">work</b>.
    $$W = \vec{\mathbf F}_\parallel \cdot \Delta\vec{\mathbf d}$$
    $$\Delta E_k = \Sigma W$$
</p>
<p><b class="Red">Power</b> (measured in watts) is the <em>rate</em> at which a force does work.
    $$P = {\Delta E\over \Delta t}$$</p>
<p><b class="Red">Efficiency</b> is the ratio of the <em>useful</em> energy output compared to the energy input.
    $$\epsilon = {\Delta E_{useful}\over |\Delta E_{input}|}$$</p>
