    <li>A 50.0-gram Hot Wheels® car is at rest at ground level. The toy car is set in motion using a spring launcher with an elastic constant \(k\) = 90.0 N/m that has been compressed 10.0 cm. The car follows a track to the finish line 30.0 cm above ground level.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the car’s speed as it crosses the finish line. Assume there is no change in the system’s mechanical energy.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$E_{elas} = \frac{1}{2} k(\Delta L)^2 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2} (90.0\ N/m) (0.100\ m)^2 = 0.450\ J}$$
$$E_g = mgh = \mathrm{0.0500\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 0.300\ m = 0.147\ J}$$
$$E_k = \Sigma E - E_g = \mathrm{0.450\ J - 0.147\ J = 0.303\ J}$$

$$E_{kf} = \frac{1}{2} mv_f^2$$
$$\frac{2E_{kf}}{m} = v_f^2$$
$$v_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E_{kf}}{m}}
    = \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 0.30285\ J}{0.0500\ kg}} = 3.48\ m/s}$$

    <li>A lacrosse ball is made of an elastic material so that when it strikes a rigid object (like a concrete floor or metal goal post) the ball compresses and converts most of the kinetic energy into elastic potential energy. This energy is then mostly converted back to kinetic energy as the ball decompresses. By what distance does a 225-gram lacrosse ball compress when it strikes the floor at 7.00 m/s if the elasticity of the ball is \(k\) = 8000 N/m?</li>

        <li>Repeat question (b) for a 12.0 kg object. Does the mass seem to matter? If not, explain why it does not.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$E_{gi} = mgh_i = \mathrm{12.0\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 3.00\ m = 353\ J}$$
$$E_{gf} = mgh_f = \mathrm{12.0\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 1.50\ m = 177\ J}$$
$$E_{kf} = E_{gi} - E_{gf} = \mathrm{177\ J}$$
$$v_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E_{kf}}{m}} = \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 177\ J}{12.0\ kg}} = 5.42\ m/s}$$
Because the kinetic and gravitational potential energy are both proportional to the mass, the mass actually cancels. The numerator and denominator are both larger by the same factor.

        <li>If we were to measure the speeds of these objects, why would the “real-life” results be less than what we calculated?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The real-life speeds would be slower because air resistance converts some of the initial energy into sound or thermal energy.</div>

        <li>What happens to the ball’s mechanical energy when it contacts the ground?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Some of the energy will be transformed into sound or thermal energy and some may remain as kinetic energy if the ball bounces.</div>

        <p>In the illustrated pulley system, \(m_1\) = 15.0 kg, \(m_2\) = 8.50 kg, and \(h\) = 3.00 m. The masses are released from rest. A pulley system is “ideal” when there is no friction or air resistance, and its rotational energy is negligible. The mechanical energy of the masses is assumed to be constant.</p>
        <p class="Center"><img alt="Pulley" src="energy/assign/img/pulley.png"/></p>
        <p>Your energy bar charts for this scenario should have four bars: \(E_{k1}\), \(E_{k2}\), \(E_{g1}\), and \(E_{g2}\). Calculate the final speed of the masses just before \(m_1\) contacts the ground.</p>

$$E_{g2} = m_2gh = \mathrm{8.50\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 3.00\ m = 250\ J}$$
$$E_k = \Sigma E - E_g = \mathrm{441.45\ J - 250.155\ J = 191\ J}$$
This is the combined kinetic energy of both masses!
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2} m_1v^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2v^2$$
Since the masses are attached, they have the same speed, so you can factor out the \(v^2\)...
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2)v^2$$
$$v^2 = \frac{2E_k}{m_1 + m_2}$$
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m_1 + m_2}}
    = \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 191.295\ J}{15.0\ kg + 8.50\ kg}} = 4.03\ m/s}$$
Now we can calculate the kinetic energies of the masses separately...
$$E_{k1} = \frac{1}{2} m_1v^2 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2} (15.0\ kg)(4.0349\ m/s)^2 = 122.1\ J}$$
$$E_{k2} = \frac{1}{2} m_2v^2 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2} (8.50\ kg)(4.0349\ m/s)^2 = 69.2\ J}$$
