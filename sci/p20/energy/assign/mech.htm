The mechanical energy gets transformed into gravitational potential energy:

    <li>A pinball game uses a spring that is stretched by 12.0 cm to launch a ball (\(m\) = 75.0 g) to start the game. After the spring is released, the speed of the ball is 6.00 m/s. Calculate the (a) mechanical energy of the system, and (b) elastic constant of the spring. Draw energy bar charts for the system before and after launch.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
<p>After the ball is set in motion, it only has kinetic energy, so the mechanical energy is:
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
= \mathrm{\frac{1}{2} (0.0750\ kg) (6.00\ m/s)^2
= 1.35\ J}$$
<a href="https://sci.davidmaccarthy.repl.co/p20/energy/barchart.html?%7B%22data%22:[0,1.35],%22labels%22:[%22Ee%22,%22Ek%22],%22yMax%22:1.5,%22grid%22:0.25,%22format%22:2,%22margin%22:[104,6,54,24]%7D">Bar Chart</a></p>

<p>Before the ball is set in motion, the mechanical energy is in the form of elastic potential energy:
$$E_{elas} = \frac{1}{2} k(\Delta L)^2$$
$$2E_{elas} = k(\Delta L)^2$$
$$k = \frac{2E_{elas}}{(\Delta L)^2}
= \mathrm{\frac{2\cdot 1.35\ J}{(0.120\ m)^2} = 188\ N/m}$$

    <li>A solid metal ball with a mass of 200 grams rolls down a ramp starting from rest. When the ball is halfway down the ramp, its speed is measured to be 2.00 m/s. For a solid sphere that rolls without slipping, the rotational energy equation is: $$E_r=\frac{1}{5}mv^2$$
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the ball’s kinetic and rotational energies.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
= \mathrm{\frac{1}{2} (0.200\ kg) (2.00\ m/s)^2 = 0.400\ J}$$
$$E_{rotn} = \frac{1}{5}mv^2
= \mathrm{\frac{1}{5} (0.200\ kg) (2.00\ m/s)^2 = 0.160\ J}$$
        </div>

        <li>Calculate the ball’s gravitational potential energy and its mechanical energy. Remember that the ball is halfway down the ramp at this point. Assume there is no change in the mechanical energy as the ball rolls. [Before trying to answer this, draw two separate energy bar charts for the system at the (i) top and (ii) halfway point of the hill.]</li>
        <div class="Answer">
Because the ball is at the halfway point, it has half of the gravitational potential energy that it started with; the other half has become kinetic and rotational energy. Thus:
$$E_g = E_k + E_{rotn} = \mathrm{0.400\ J + 0.160\ J = 0.560\ J}$$
$$\Sigma E = E_g + E_k + E_{rotn} = \mathrm{0.560\ J + 0.400\ J + 0.160\ J = 1.12\ J}$$
        </div>

        <li>Calculate the height from which the ball was released.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$E_g = mgh$$
$$h = \frac{E_g}{mg}
    = \mathrm{\frac{1.12\ J}{0.200\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2} = 0.571\ m}$$
