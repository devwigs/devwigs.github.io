<h3>Review</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Define force and work (as these terms are used in physics) and explain the relationship between the two concepts.</li>
    <li>Identify the common types of forces and the describe circumstances under which those forces arise.</li>
    <li>What do we mean by conservative and non-conservative forces? Give examples of each type of force.</li>
    <li>How should we interpret positive or negative amounts of work?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Practice</h3>
<ol>
    <li>A student slowly lifts a weight at constant speed. How is it possible that the student is doing work, but the object is not gaining kinetic energy?</li>
    <div class="Answer">The force the student applies is not the only force. The force of gravity is acting in the opposite direction. The student is doing a positive amount of work, while gravity does a negative amount of work. The total work done is zero if the speed is constant.</div>

    <li>A 30.0-kilogram student slides down an icy hill on a sled. The student’s speed is 3.00 m/s at the top of the 5.00-metre high hill. When the student reaches the bottom of the hill, her speed has increased to 8.00 m/s.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Draw energy bar graphs for the student’s initial (top of hill) and final (bottom of hill) state. Show all calculations.</li>

        <li>Draw an energy flow diagram for this scenario. Label the amount of work done by each force (gravity, friction/air resistance).</li>

    <li>A 200-gram package is dropped from the top of a 27.6-metre tall building. The package strikes the ground with a speed of 18.4 m/s. Use a “LOL Diagram” (i.e. energy bar charts for the initial and final state, plus an energy flow diagram) to determine how much “waste” (sound and thermal energy) was produced due to the air resistance force. Label the work done by each force.</li>

    <li>A 1200 kg car is moving at 40.0 km/h initially. When the driver steps on the accelerator, the car experiences an applied force due to the engine that does 50.0 kJ of work while moving 100 metres. While the car is accelerating, –15.0 kilojoules of work results from friction and air resistance. Use a LOL Diagram to determine the final speed of the car.</li>
