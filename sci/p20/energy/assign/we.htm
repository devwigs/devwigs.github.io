<h3>Practice</h3>
<ol>
    <li>A student pushes a 15.0-kilogram crate from rest with a force of 50.0 newtons for 1.25 seconds. The crate moves 1.50 metres while the student is pushing.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>How much work did the student (applied force) do?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$W_a = \vec{\mathbf F}_a \cdot \Delta\vec{\mathbf d} = \mathrm{50.0\ N \cdot 1.50\ m = 75.0\ J}$$
        </div>

        <li>If there was no friction or air resistance acting on the crate, how much kinetic energy would the crate have? Explain.</li>        
        <div class="Answer">The crate has no energy initially because it is at rest. Since it gains 75.0 joules due to the applied force, its final kinetic energy will be 75.0 J.</div>

        <li>Calculate the final velocity of the crate when there is no friction.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$v_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}} = \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 75.0\ J}{15.0\ kg}} = 3.16\ m/s}$$
        </div>

        <li>Suppose there is a friction force of 20.0 N opposing the motion. Calculate the work done by the friction force and the final speed.</li>        
        <div class="Answer">
$$W_f = \vec{\mathbf F}_f \cdot \Delta\vec{\mathbf d} = \mathrm{-20.0\ N \cdot 1.50\ m = -30.0\ J}$$
The change in kinetic energy is the total work done by both forces:
$$\Delta E_k = W_a + W_f = \mathrm{75.0\ J + (-30.0\ J) = 45.0\ J}$$
$$v_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}} = \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 45.0\ J}{15.0\ kg}} = 2.45\ m/s}$$

    <li>A 75.0 kg cyclist is initially moving at 5.00 m/s. She then accelerates to a final speed of 12.0 m/s while moving 20.0 metres. Neglect the effects of air resistance and friction.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>How much work did the student do in accelerating herself?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$E_{ki} = \frac{1}{2} mv_i^2 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2} (75.0\ kg) (5.00\ m/s)^2 = 937.5\ J}$$
$$E_{kf} = \frac{1}{2} mv_f^2 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2} (75.0\ kg) (12.0\ m/s)^2 = 5400 J\ J}$$
$$W = E_{kf} - E_{ki} = \mathrm{5400\ J - 937.5\ J = 4463\ J}$$

    <li><p>When a tennis player serves the ball, the amount of force applied by the racket to the ball depends on how much the strings stretch. The graph below shows how the force varies during a serve.</p>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the work done on the tennis ball.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
For the first 40 cm: $$W_1 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2} 80\ N \cdot 0.40\ m = 16\ J}$$
For the next 10 cm: $$W_2 = \mathrm{80\ N \cdot 0.10\ m = 8.0\ J}$$
For the last 25 cm: $$W_3 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2} 80\ N \cdot 0.25\ m = 10\ J}$$
The total work is: $$W = W_1 + W_2 + W_3 = \mathrm{34\ J}$$

        <li>If the mass of the tennis ball is 80.0 grams and it was initially at rest, what would its speed be as it leaves the racket?</li>
        <div class="Answer">

    <li>A student uses 10.0 newtons of force to push a 5.00-kilogram mass 2.00 metres up an 8.00° incline. The mass starts and ends at rest. Calculate (a) the amount of “waste” (sound and thermal energy) produced and (b) the average force of friction acting on the mass.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p class="Center"><img src="p20/energy/assign/img/ramp_trig.png" alt="Diagram"/></p>
First find the height using trogonometry:
$$\sin(8.00^\circ) = \frac{h_f}{\Delta d}$$
$$h_f = \Delta d\cdot \sin(8.00^\circ) = \mathrm{2.00\ m\cdot\sin(8.00^\circ) = 0.278\ m}$$
Now calculate the gravitational potential energy at the top:
$$E_{gf} = mgh_f = \mathrm{5.00\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 0.278\ m = 13.7\ J}$$
Next calculate the work done by the applied force:
$$W_a = \vec{\mathbf F}_a \cdot \Delta\vec{\mathbf d} = \mathrm{10.0\ N \cdot 2.00\ m = 20.0\ J}$$
Using energy conservation, the final energy (waste and gravitational potential) must equal the energy added:
$$E_{waste} + \mathrm{13.7\ J = 20.0\ J}$$
$$E_{waste} = \mathrm{20.0\ J - 13.7\ J = 6.35\ J}$$
The waste energy is the (negative of) work done by friction:
$$\vec{\mathbf F}_f = \frac{W_f}{\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}} = \mathrm{\frac{-6.35\ J}{2.00\ m} = -3.17\ N}$$
