    <li>A student running on a treadmill burns 120 kJ of food energy and produces 97.2 kJ of heat. What is the efficiency of the energy transformation?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
$$\Delta E_{useful} = \Delta E_{input} − \Delta E_{waste} = \mathrm{120\ kJ - 97.2\ kJ = 22.8\ kJ}$$
$$\epsilon = \frac{\Delta E_{useful}}{\Delta E_{input}} = \mathrm{\frac{22.8\ kJ}{120\ kJ} = 0.190 = 19.0\%}$$

    <li>How does power relate to work? For example, can a car with a more powerful engine always do more work than a car with a less powerful engine?</li>
    <div class="Answer">The amount of work an engine can do depends on how much fuel is available. The power indicates how quickly that work can be done. A car with a full gas tank and an underpowered engine can do more total work than a more powerful engine with an empty gas tank.</div>

    <li>How long will it take for a car engine that develops 75.0 kW of power to do 247 kJ of work in accelerating the car to highway speed?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
$$P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}$$
$$P\Delta t = \Delta E$$
$$\Delta t = \frac{\Delta E}{P} = \mathrm{\frac{247000\ J}{75000\ W} = 3.29\ s}$$

    <li>A 60.0-kilogram sprinter metabolizes 7.00 kilojoules of food energy while accelerating from rest to 8.00 m/s over 2.00 seconds. Calculate:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>the efficiency of the energy transformation.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$\Delta E_{input} = \mathrm{7000\ J}$$
$$\Delta E_{useful} = E_{kf} = \frac{1}{2} mv_f^2 = \mathrm{\frac{1}{2} (60.0\ kg) (8.00\ m/s)^2 = 1920\ J}$$
$$\epsilon  = \frac{\Delta E_{useful}}{\Delta E_{input}} = \mathrm{\frac{1920\ J}{7000\ J} = 0.274 = 27.4\%}$$
        </div>
    
        <li>the power developed by the student.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t} = \mathrm{\frac{1920\ J}{2.00\ s} = 960 W}$$
        </div>
    
        <li>the amount of thermal and sound (“waste”) energy produced by the student.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$\Delta E_{waste} = \Delta E_{input} - \Delta E_{useful} = \mathrm{7000\ J - 1920\ J = 5080\ J}$$

    <li>The diesel engine of a locomotive has an efficiency of 12.5% in transforming the chemical energy of the fuel into useful work as the locomotive hauls the train up a hill.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>If the engine does 4.25 × 10<sup>7</sup> J of useful work in hauling the train up the hill, how much chemical energy (fuel) did the engine consume?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$\epsilon  = \frac{\Delta E_{useful}}{\Delta E_{input}}$$
$$\epsilon \Delta E_{input} = \Delta E_{useful}$$
$$\Delta E_{input} = \frac{\Delta E_{useful}}{\epsilon}
    = \mathrm{\frac{4.25\times 10^7\ J}{0.125} = 3.40\times 10^8\ J}$$
        </div>
    
        <li>How much waste (thermal and sound energy) did the engine produce?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
$$\begin{align}\Delta E_{waste} &= \Delta E_{input} - \Delta E_{useful}
\\ &= \mathrm{3.40\times 10^8\ J - 4.25\times 10^7\ J}
\\ &= \mathrm{2.98\times 10^8\ J} \end{align}$$
