<h1>Power</h1>
<p>The <em>rate</em> at which a force does work is called <em class="Defn">power</em>.</p>
<ul data-slide="1">
	<li>Power is a measure of how quickly an energy-transforming device is able to do work:$$P = {\Delta E\over \Delta t}$$</li>
	<li data-slide="2">The unit of power is J/s, which is called watts (W).</li>
	<li data-slide="3">Do not confuse the symbol for the unit W (watts) with the symbol for the variable <i>W</i> (work).</li>

<h1>Efficiency</h1>
<p>Most energy transformations produce unwanted “waste” forms of energy.</p>
<ul data-slide="5">
	<li>For example, a light bulb is intended to transform electrical energy into light energy. In reality, a significant fraction of the energy is wasted in the form of heat.</li>
</ul>
<p data-slide="6">Scientists use the concept of <em class="Defn">efficiency</em> to describe the fraction or percentage of the energy input that is transformed into its intended or useful output:$$\epsilon = {\Delta E_{useful} \over |\Delta E_{input}|}$$</p>
<ul data-slide="7">
	<li>To say that a light bulb is 20% efficient means that 20% of the electrical energy consumed becomes light energy, and the remaining 80% of the energy consumed becomes waste (thermal energy).</li>
</ul>
