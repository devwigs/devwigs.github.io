<h1>Energy</h1>
<p ><em class="Defn">Energy</em> is the ability to produces <em>changes</em> in motion, temperature, or other physical or chemical properties.</p>
<ul data-slide="1">
    <li>Energy comes in many different forms.</li> 
    <li data-slide="2">Energy is a <em>scalar</em> quantity; it has no direction.</li>
    <li data-slide="3">Energy is a <em>conserved</em> quantity.</li>
    <li data-slide="4">The SI unit of energy is called the <em>joule</em>. A joule can be expressed in terms of simpler units:$$\mathrm {J = N\cdot m = kg \cdot {m^2\over s^2}}$$</li>
</ul>

<h1>Kinetic Energy</h1>
<p>Motion is itself a form of energy, which we call the <em class="Defn">kinetic energy</em>:$$E_k = {1 \over 2} mv^2$$</p>
<ul data-slide="6">
    <li>In this equation, \(m\) is the <em>mass</em> of the object in kilograms.</li>
    <li data-slide="7">The symbol \(v\) is the <em>speed</em> of the object in metres per second (m/s).</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section data-slide="8">
<h1>Rotational Energy</h1>
    <p>An object that is spinning in place has energy. We call this <em>rotational energy</em>.</p>
    <ul data-slide="9">
        <li>We can use rotational energy to pull or lift an object (e.g. a winch) or to create electricity (e.g. a generator).</li> 
        <li data-slide="10">The equation for rotational energy depends on the shape of the object and whether it is solid or hollow.</li>
        <li data-slide="11">A ball rolling down a ramp has <em>both</em> kinetic and rotational energy.</li>
    </ul>

<section data-slide="12">
<h1>Gravitational Potential Energy</h1><!-- https://freesvg.org/img/mountainclimbing.png -->
    <p>When an object is elevated above the ground, it has energy because gravity will cause the object to move when it is released.</p>
    <p data-slide="13">This type of energy is called <em class="Defn">gravitational potential energy</em>:$$E_g = mgh$$</p>
    <ul data-slide="14">
        <li>In this equation, \(g\) is the <em>gravitational field strength</em>. Close to Earth’s surface, \(g = 9.81\ {\mathrm{m/s^2}}\).</li>
        <li data-slide="15">The symbol \(h\) is the <em>height</em> of the object relative to the origin (usually the ground).</li>
        <li data-slide="16">As with kinetic energy, \(m\) is the mass in kilograms.</li>
        <li data-slide="17">This formula is only valid when the gravitational field is constant and uniform.</li>
    </ul>

<section data-slide="18">
<h1>Elastic Potential Energy</h1>
    <p><em class="Defn">Elasticity</em> is a property of objects that return to their original shape when they are stretched or compressed.</p>
    <ul data-slide="19">
        <li>Elastic objects include springs, rubber bands, bungees, and archery bows.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-slide="20">The energy stored in a stretched or compressed elastic is called <em class="Defn">elastic potential energy</em>:$$E_{elas} = {1\over 2}k \left({\Delta L}\right)^2$$</p>
    <ul data-slide="21">
        <li>The variable \(k\) is called the <em class="Defn">elastic constant</em>. It measures the strength of the elastic object in newtons per metre (N/m).</li>
        <li data-slide="22">The variable \(\Delta L\) is the distance the elastic is stretched or compressed from its equilibrium shape.</li>
    </ul>

<section data-slide="23">
<h1>Mechanical Forms of Energy</h1>
    <p>Types of energy that are related to the objects’ motion are called <em class="Defn">mechanical</em> forms of energy. Mechanical energy includes:</p>
    <table data-slide="24" class="Normal">
        <tr><td style="width:14em">Kinetic Energy</td><td style="width:10em">\(E_k = {1 \over 2} mv^2\)</td></tr>
        <tr data-slide="25"><td>Gravitational Potential Energy</td><td>\(E_g = mgh\)</td></tr>
        <tr data-slide="26"><td>Elastic Potential Energy</td><td>\(E_{elas} = {1\over 2}k \left({\Delta L}\right)^2\)</td></tr>
        <tr data-slide="27"><td>Rotational Energy</td><td>Depends on object</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p data-slide="28">Scientists use the term “mechanical energy” to mean the <em>total</em> of <em>all</em> mechanical forms of energy present in a system at a particular instant in time.</p>

<section class="Slide" data-slide="29">
<h1>Non-Mechanical Forms of Energy</h1>
    <p>There are many different forms of energy that are related to properties other than motion (e.g. temperature or chemical composition).</p>
    <p data-slide="30">Some non-mechanical forms of energy include:</p>
    <ul data-slide="30">
        <li>Thermal energy</li>
        <li data-slide="31">Sound energy</li>
        <li data-slide="32">Electrical energy</li>
        <li data-slide="33">Chemical energy</li>
        <li data-slide="34">Nuclear energy</li>
        <li data-slide="35">Light and other electromagnetic energy</li>
