<section id="vis" data-last="?"><h3>Visualizing Gravity</h3>
<p>We saw in the last activity that there are several ways to visualize gravity:</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>A graph of the gravitational <em class="Defn">equipotentials</em> shows points that have the same gravitational potential energy.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Gravitational <em class="Defn">field lines</em> (which are <em>perpendicular</em> to the equipotentials) show the acceleration due to gravity at each point.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Animated visualizations can also illustrate the gravitational field (acceleration) with moving particles.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="ad" data-last="?"><h3>Action at a Distance</h3>
<p>Newton’s equation for gravitational force implies that the force between masses can act over large distances.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>Each mass somehow “knows” the position and the motion of all of the other distant masses that affect it gravitationally.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Scientists found this action at a distance to be a very complicated way of running the universe and sought a simpler explanation of the gravitational attraction.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="g" data-last="?"><h3>Gravitational Field</h3>
<p>Physicists devised the concept of a <em class="Defn">gravitational field</em>...</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>The gravitational field is a property of space that <em class="Defn">mediates</em> the gravitational attraction.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">Rather than exerting forces on each diretly over large distances, every mass alters the field around it, and each mass moves within the field that it finds itself in.</li>
</ul>
<p data-mark="+">As an analogy, think of two bowling balls placed on a trampoline...</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>The bowling balls will roll toward each other, as if there were some force of attraction between them.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">What really happens is that the bowling balls change the shape of the trampoline, and each ball rolls according to the shape of the trampoline in its own location.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">If we place a large number of bowling balls, baseballs, and golf balls on the trampoline, each one will affect the shape of the surface; the bowling balls will have more effect than the golf balls!</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The shape of the trampoline will become very complicated and each ball will roll in a complicated trajectory.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">However, in this model none of the various objects needs to know where any of the other objects is located.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">When the arrangement of sources changes, there will be a <em>time delay</em> as <em>gravitational waves</em> pass before the field settles into a new shape.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="m" data-last="?"><h3>Sources & Test Masses</h3>
<p>To <em>measure</em> the shape of the trampoline at any particular spot, as a result of all the masses on the trampoline, we can observe a small object at that spot, say a ping-pong ball which is light enough to have negligible effect on the trampoline’s shape. The ping-pong ball’s acceleration will tell us how steeply and in what direction the trampoline slopes.</p>
<ul data-mark="+">
    <li>If we can think of space as a 3D trampoline, the gravitational field represents its “shape”.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">We measure the gravitational field by placing a tiny <em class="Defn">test mass</em> at some point in space, and by observing its acceleration when there are no forces except gravity acting on it.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The masses that create the gravitational field are known as the <em class="Defn">field masses</em>, or the <em class="Defn">sources</em> of the field.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">For <em>each</em> source, we can calculate the gravitational field as $$g = {GM\over r^2}$$ where \(r\) is the separation between the source and test mass.</li>
    <li data-mark="+">The <em>net</em> gravitational field (the test mass acceleration) is the <em>vector total</em> of the individual \(\vec{\mathbf g}\) values.</li>
</ul>

<section id="ex1" data-last="?"><h3>Example 1</h3>
<p class="Blue">Find the gravitational field at the midpoint between two planets of mass \(6.00\times 10^{24}\ \mathrm {kg}\) and \(4.00\times 10^{24}\ \mathrm {kg}\) that are separated by \(8.00\times 10^8\ {\mathrm m}\).</p>
</section>

<section id="ex2" data-last="?"><h3>Example 2</h3>
<p class="Blue">Find the gravitational field for the previous example at a point that is \(1.00\times 10^8\ \mathrm{m}\) from the midpoint in a perpendicular direction.</p>
