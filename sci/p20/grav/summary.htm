<p><b class="Red">Gravitational Force</b> is a “universal” phenomenon that exists between all masses.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In a uniform gravitational field (for example near Earth’s surface) all test objects experience the same acceleration when gravity is the only force, regardless of their mass.</li>
    <li>The acceleration due to gravity is called \(\vec{\mathbf g}\) and has a value of about \(\mathrm{9.81 m/s^2}\) on Earth.</li>
    <li>More generally, we can calculate \(g\) (due to a <b class="Red">source</b> \(M\) at a separation \(r\)) using <b class="Red">Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation</b>:
        $$g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$
</ul>

<p>The force of gravity (also called <b class="Red">weight</b>) is related to the <b class="Red">test mass</b> (the object experiencing the force) as:
$${\vec{\mathbf{F}}}_g=m\vec{\mathbf{g}}$$</p>
<ul>
    <li>By combining the two equations, the gravitational force that any two masses separated by \(r\) exert on each other is:
        $$F_g=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$</li>
</ul>

<p><b class="Red">Cavendish’s torsion balance experiment</b> determined the value of the <b class="Red">universal gravitational constant</b> to be $$G = \mathrm{6.67 \times 10^{-11}\ \frac{N\cdot m^2}{kg^2}}$$</p>

<ul>
    <li>A torsion balance measures force (responding variable) by balancing the force trying to twist the apparatus (i.e. gravity) with the wire’s tendency to untwist itself.</li>
    <li>Cavendish manipulated the separation between masses while controlling the masses themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation is an <b class="Red">inverse square law</b>, which means that when the separation increases by a factor of 2, for example, the gravitational force weakens by a factor of 4.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The concept of <b class="Red">action at a distance</b> implies that masses can somehow reach out over large distances to instantaneously exert force on each other.</li>
    <li>By contrast, the idea of a <b class="Red">gravitational field</b> is that each mass affects the space surrounding it and moves within the combined field of all other masses, similar to the way that the shape of a trampoline <b class="Red">mediates</b> the motion of objects placed upon it.</li>
    <li>The field concept implies that changes in the gravitational field can propagate like waves, and the effects will be delayed in proportion to how far away the observer is.</li>
    <li>A gravitational field can be visualized by drawing <b class="Red">equipotentials</b> (\(E_g\)) and/or <b class="Red">gravitational field lines</b> (\(\vec{\mathbf g}\)). The field lines will always cross the equipotentials at exactly 90°.</li>
</ul>
