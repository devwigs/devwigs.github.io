<h1>Position-Time Graphs</h1>
<p>Here is the diagram for the motion of a bike that we used as an example in the last lesson:</p>
<p data-slide="0" class="Center"><img src="kin1d/img/bike1.png" alt="Bike" class="Zoom"/></p>
<p class="Caption" data-slide="1">Motion of a Bicycle</p>
<table class="w6" data-slide="1">
    <thead><tr><td><b>Time</b><br/>\(t\) / s</td><td><b>Position</b><br/>\(\Delta{\vec{\mathbf d}}\) / m</td></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr><td>0.0</td><td>–5.0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1.0</td><td>–2.0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2.0</td><td>+1.0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3.0</td><td>+4.0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4.0</td><td>+7.0</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p data-slide="2">This is an example of <em class="Defn">uniform motion</em>, because the bike is always moving through the same displacement in the same amount of time (+3.0 metres every 1.0 seconds.)</p>
<ul data-slide="3">
	<li>When we graph the \({\vec{\mathbf d}}\mathrm{-}t\) data for uniform motion, it will be a straight line:</li>
</ul>

<h1>Velocity</h1>
<ul>
	<li>When we calculate the velocity of the bike, we are actually calculating the <em>slope</em> of the line:$${\vec{\mathbf v}} = {\Delta{\vec{\mathbf d}} \over \Delta t} = {\mathrm{{+12.0\ m \over 4.0\ s} = 3.0\ m/s}}$$</li>
	<li data-slide="5">The displacement \(\Delta{\vec{\mathbf d}}\) is the “rise” of the graph (from –5.0 to +7.0 m), and the time \(\Delta t\) is the “run” (from 0.0 to 4.0 seconds).</li>
	<li data-slide="6">Because the line is straight, the slope (velocity) is the same no matter which points on the line we use to calculate it: the bike’s velocity is constant.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section data-slide="7">
<h1>Interpreting the Graph</h1>
<p>Knowing that slope represents the velocity, we can interpret this and other motion graphs as follows.</p>
<ul data-slide="8">
	<li>Upward slope means forward motion (positive velocity); downward slope means reverse motion (negative velocity).</li>
	<li data-slide="9">Steep sections of a graph indicate a fast velocity; shallow segments indicate a slower velocity.</li>
	<li data-slide="10">Straight segments of the graph have constant velocity.</li>
	<li data-slide="11">Horizontal (flat) segments indicate an object at rest (\(\vec{\mathbf v}\) = 0).</li>
	<li data-slide="12">Curved parts of the graph indicate that the velocity is changing; this is called <em class="Defn">accelerated motion</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center" data-slide="12"><img src="kin1d/img/elevator.png" class="Zoom" width="480" /></p>
<ul data-slide="13">
	<li>If the graph curves in such a way as to get steeper with time, the object is speeding up; the graph will get flatter over time when the object is slowing down.</li>
	<li data-slide="14">The <em class="Defn">instantaneous</em> velocity means the slope at a single point in time.</li>
	<li data-slide="15">You can <em>estimate</em> the instantaneous velocity by calculating the slope between two consecutive data points.</li>
	<li data-slide="16">The <em class="Defn">average</em> velocity means the slope calculate between two points that are relatively far apart in time.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Velocity-Time Graphs</h1>
<p>Sometimes we will have data collected for an object’s <em>velocity</em> rather than its position.</p>
<p class="Center"><img src="kin1d/img/radar.png" class="Zoom" width="480"/></p>
<ul data-slide="18">
	<li>For uniform motion, the \(\vec{\mathrm v}\)-\(t\) graph must be <em>horizontal</em>.</li>
	<li data-slide="19">A sloped graph (linear or curved) indicates accelerated motion.</li>
	<li data-slide="20">The area under any section of the graph indicates the object’s displacment during that time interval.</li>
</ul>
