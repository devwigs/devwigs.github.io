<p>Data that can be represented in the form of a tree is called <em class="Defn">hierarchical data</em>.
	One example could be a database of Canadian government jurisdictions. Only a small portion of the data tree
	is shown below as the complete database would be huge!</p>
<p class="Center"><img class="Wide" src="img/canada_tree.png" alt="Tree"/></p>

<p>As the example shows, the country consists of several provinces (or territories), each of which may be
	divided into numerous cities, counties, towns, and districts. These municipalities may each contain several
	communities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each item within the data tree (i.e. each box in the diagram above) is called a <em class="Defn">node</em>.</li>
<li>Nodes that are connected directly to each other have a parent-child relationship. The “higher” level node
	is called the <em class="Defn">parent</em> and the “lower” level node is the <em class="Defn">child</em>.</li>
<li>For example, the <code>Municipality</code> nodes representing Edmonton and Strathcona County are children
	of the <code>Province</code> node representing Alberta. The <code>Province</code> node is the parent of
	the <code>Municipality</code> nodes.</li>
<li>Any node may have many children; however, a node can only have one parent. In fact, every node has exactly
	one parent, except for the very top level node (<code>Country</code> in this example) which does not have
	a parent at all. This top level node is called the <em class="Defn">root</em> node of the data tree.</li>
<li>Nodes that have the same parent are <em class="Defn">siblings</em>. For example, the <code>Municipality</code>
	nodes for Edmonton and Strathcona County are siblings because they both have the Alberta <code>Province</code>
	node as their parent.</li>
<li>The node representing London, Ontario is not a sibling to Edmonton or Strathcona County since it has a
	different parent. (Although London would be siblings with other municipalities in Ontario, like Toronto or
	Niagara Falls.)</li>
<li>The node names (<code>Country</code>, <code>Province</code>, <code>Municipality</code>,
	<code>Community</code>) are general descriptions of the type of information they represent.</li>
<li>Each node may have several pieces of data attached to it. Each piece of data is called an
	<em class="Defn">attribute</em> of the node. For example, each <code>Province</code> node has a
	<code>name</code> attribute and a <code>capital</code> attribute. For the <code>Province</code> node
	representing Alberta, the capital attribute has the value “Edmonton”.</li>
</ul>
