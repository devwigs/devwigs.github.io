<p>For all questions, your programs must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>use appropriate comments and docstrings;</li>
    <li>use descriptive variable names;</li>
    <li>use “Input-Processing-Output” (IPO) program structure; </li>
    <li>be user-friendly. (Running the program should be easy, even for someone not already familiar with what the program does.)</li>
</ul><hr/>

<p>Create a Python program in your <code>CS10</code> repl using the file <code>sp4_hangman.py</code>. In this program, you are to complete the "Hangman" game that you started in the <a href="#accum">Accumulation</a> assignment. Your program should present the user with a clue such as the following...</p>
<pre class="IO">70's Movie: **** ****
Guess a letter:</pre>

<p>When the user guesses a letter correctly, the program should replace the appropriate stars by the guessed letter. At a minimum, your program should continue to let the user guess until all letters are revealed. To make the game better, you can have the program do some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ask the user to play again when the game is finished with a new clue,</li>
    <li>print the letters that have already been guessed before the user is asked to guess again,</li>
    <li>prevent the user from guessing letters that have already been guessed,</li>
    <li>allow a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses before the player loses,</li>
    <li>convert all guesses and answers to upper case,</li>
    <li>keep track of how many games the player wins and loses.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can make your game choose randomly from a list of puzzles using the following code (remember to import the <code>choice</code> function from the <code>random</code> module):</p>
<pre class="Code" data-echo="copy">clue, answer = choice([
    ("70's Movie", "STAR WARS"),
    ("Canadian City", "VANCOUVER, BC"),
    ("Pro Athlete", "CONNOR MCDAVID")
])</pre>
<p>Here is a sample of what the start of the program might look like with the user input shown in blue.</p>
<pre class="IO">70's Movie: **** ****
Guess a letter: <span class="Blue">e</span>
Incorrect!

Bad Guesses: E
70's Movie: **** ****
Guess a letter: <span class="Blue">a</span>
Correct!

Bad Guesses: E
70's Movie: **A* *A**
Guess a letter: <span class="Blue">s</span>
Correct!

Bad Guesses: E
70's Movie: S*A* *A*S
Guess a letter: <span class="Blue">r</span>
</pre>
