<p>For all questions, your programs must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>use appropriate comments and docstrings;</li>
    <li>use descriptive variable names;</li>
    <li>use “Input-Processing-Output” (IPO) program structure; </li>
    <li>be user-friendly. (Running the program should be easy, even for someone not already familiar with what the program does.)</li>
</ul><hr/>

<p>Create a Python program in your <code>CS10</code> repl with the file name <code>sp2_letterSquare.py</code>. Write a program that does the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ask the user to type a letter. If the user enters something that is not exactly one character long or is not a letter between <code>'A'</code> and <code>'Z'</code>, the program must keep asking until it receives valid input.</li>
    <li>The program should then draw a “letter square” in the console as described below.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="IO">Enter a letter: <span class="Blue">7</span>
That is not a letter!

Enter a letter: <span class="Blue">E</span>

AAAAAAAAA
ABBBBBBBA
ABCCCCCBA
ABCDDDCBA
ABCDEDCBA
ABCDDDCBA
ABCCCCCBA
ABBBBBBBA
AAAAAAAAA</pre>
<ul>
    <li>The user’s letter should appear in the middle of the square.</li>
    <li>The letter preceding the user’s letter should be printed in a 3x3 square surrounding the first letter.</li>
    <li>The next letter before should be printed in a 5x5 square surrounding the 3x3 square.</li>
    <li>Continue printing all letters until the largest square consists of the letter <code>'A'</code>.</li>
	<li>Note that your program will not be able to print the letters in the order described!</li>
    <li>It may be helpful to calculate how far each position in the square is from the edge: spots on one of the four edges will always be <code>"A"</code> and spots that are three places from the <em>closest</em> edge will always be <code>"D"</code>.</li>
</ul>
