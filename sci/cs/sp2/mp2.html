<p>For all questions, your programs must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>use appropriate comments and docstrings;</li>
    <li>use descriptive variable names;</li>
    <li>use “Input-Processing-Output” (IPO) program structure; </li>
    <li>be user-friendly. (Running the program should be easy, even for someone not already familiar with what the program does.)</li>
</ul><hr/>

<p>Create a Python program in your <code>CS10</code> repl using the file <code>sp2_guess.py</code>. Write an interactive number guessing game that does the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The computer selects a random integer between 1 and 100.</li>
    <li>Ask the user to guess the number.</li>
    <li>The program should then tell the user if their guess is too high or too low.</li>
    <li>Continue asking for a guess until the user guesses correctly.</li>
    <li>Ask the user whether to quit or play again.</li>
    <li>Bonus: Have the program count how many guesses it takes to get the correct number.</li>
    <li>Below is some sample output with the user’s input shown in blue.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="IO">I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100...
Guess? <span class="Blue">50</span>
Too high!

Guess? <span class="Blue">20</span>
Too low!

Guess? <span class="Blue">40</span>
Too low!

Guess? <span class="Blue">47</span>
That's right! You took 4 tries to guess the number.

Play again? [y/n] <span class="Blue">n</span>
Goodbye.</pre>
