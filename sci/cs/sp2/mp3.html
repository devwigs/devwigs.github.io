<p>For all questions, your programs must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>use appropriate comments and docstrings;</li>
    <li>use descriptive variable names;</li>
    <li>use “Input-Processing-Output” (IPO) program structure; </li>
    <li>be user-friendly. (Running the program should be easy, even for someone not already familiar with what the program does.)</li>
</ul><hr/>

<p>Create a Python program in your <code>CS10</code> repl using the file <code>sp3_loan.py</code> that calculates a loan repayment schedule. You may want to refer back to the <a href="#if">Conditional Statements</a> assignment and use a copy of your program <code>s11_loan.py</code> as a starting point.</p>
<p>Write an interactive program that does the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Asks the user to enter the amount of the loan, the annual interest rate as a percentage, and the monthly loan payment.</li>
    <li>The program should then print out a neatly formatted table showing the repayment schedule.</li>
    <li>Below is some sample output with the user’s input shown in blue.</li>
    <li>Note that the last payment amount is reduced so that the balance owing does not become negative.</li>
    <li>You cannot assume that the repayment will occur in 9 months, or any other predetermined time; the repayment time will depend on how big the payments are compared to the loan amount!</li>
</ul>
<pre class="IO">Loan amount? <span class="Blue">2000</span>
