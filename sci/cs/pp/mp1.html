<p>Create a Python program in your <code>CS20</code> repl with the file name <code>pp_hangman.py</code>. Write a program that does the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Chooses a clue and answer.</li>
    <li>Displays the clue and a hint to the answer showing how many words and how many letters in each word.</li>
    <li>Allows the user to guess one single letter and rejects any letters already guessed.</li>
    <li>Inserts the letter into the answer if correct.</li>
    <li>Displays the number of remaining guesses and the letters guessed so far.</li>
    <li>Repeats until the user has correctly guessed the answer or has reeached the maximum of 6 bad guesses.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="IO">80's Movie: **** ****
Chances Remaining: 6

Guess a letter: <span class="Blue">A</span>

80's Movie: **A* *A**
Letters Guessed: A
Chances Remaining: 6

Guess a letter: <span class="Blue">X</span>

80's Movie: **A* *A**
Letters Guessed: AX
Chances Remaining: 5</pre>

<p>You have written a similar program in Structured Programming 2. However, you must complete this program using <em>procedural programming techniques</em>.</p>

<p>Your program must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>use appropriate comments and docstrings;</li>
    <li>use descriptive variable names;</li>
    <li>use “top-down” program design; </li>
    <li>use separate functions for each discrete task;</li>
    <li>be user-friendly. (Running the program should be easy, even for someone not already familiar with what the program does.)</li>
    <li>handle any exceptions created by bad user input. </li>
</ul><hr/>
