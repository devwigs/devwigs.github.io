<h3>Programming Tools</h3><div class="Note">
<p>To write your own programs, you will need several software tools:
<ul>
    <li>A <b class="Red">text editor</b> to create and modify your programs. Ideally the editor should understand the programming language you are using so that it can help you write/fix programs.</li>
    <li>A <b class="Red">compiler</b> or <b class="Red">interpreter</b> for the programming language you are using, to translate your programs into machine language.</li>
    <li>A <b class="Red">console</b> or <b class="Red">desktop</b> to run the program in.</li>
    <li>A <b class="Red">debugger</b> to track down errors.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>An <b class="Red">Integrated Development Environment</b> (IDE) is a program that collects all of these tools in a single place, to make your work as a programmer more productive. There are many different IDE’s <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments">available for Python</a>, including...</p>

</div>

<h3>repl.it</h3><div class="Note">
<p><a href="https://repl.it" target="repl">repl.it</a> is a cloud-based IDE. Your files are saved in the cloud and
    you can access them from any computer using a web browser (<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="Browser">Google Chrome</a> or <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/" target="Browser">Mozilla Firefox</a> recommended).
    You do not need to install any software on your computer to write programs using repl.it.</p>
<p>You will need to create an account the first time you use repl.it. I recommend that you use your EIPS Google
    account to login to repl.it. Be sure to protect your privacy by not providing any information about yourself
    that you do not want to become public.</p>
<p>Once you have created an account, you can create your own coding projects (called “repls”) or create your own
    “fork” (copy) of any public projects. This IDE supports many different programming and markup languages.</p>
</div>

<h3>Thonny</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Thonny is a Python IDE designed for students who are new to programming. You may want to use Thonny instead of repl.it when
    writing programs that use graphics, since graphics-based programs tend to run slowly over the cloud. Any changes that you make
    to your project using Thonny will need to be uploaded to repl.it since Thonny does not sync files to the cloud automatically.</p>
<p>To use Thonny at home or on your own laptop, download and run the installer from the <a href="https://thonny.org" target="thonny">Thonny website</a>. A Python interpreter is included with Thonny so you do not need to install it separately.</p>
<p>After Thonny is installed, you will need to install the graphics and robotics software for this course. Go to Thonny’s “Tools” menu and select “Manage packages...” </p>
<p class="Center"><img src="game/img/thonny.png" alt="Thonny"/></p>
<ol>
    <li>Type the name of the software package, <code>sc8pr</code>.</li>
    <li>Click the button to search the Python Package Index (PyPI).</li>
    <li>Click the three dots.</li>
    <li>Select the desired version. This course assumes you are using the most recent update of <code>sc8pr 2.2</code>.</li>
    <li>Check “Upgrade Dependencies” and then click the Install button.</li>
</ol>
<p>If an error occurs while trying to install the packages, exit Thonny and re-open it <i>as an administrator</i>.</p>
</div>

<!--h3>Eclipse</h3><div class="Note">
<p><a href="https://www.eclipse.org" target="ecl">Eclipse</a> is an IDE that runs on your local computer. Software must be installed and configured before you can use it so it is not recommended for home use by beginners.</p>
<p>Like Thonny, the files you create or modify in Eclipse will be saved on the local computer or network. They will not be available on other computers unless you sync them yourself.</p>
<p>If you install Eclipse on your own computer, you will need to install <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> first.
    You will also need to install additional packages by running the following command (after installing Python but before configuring Eclipse) in your terminal program:</p>
</div-->

<h3>Other IDEs</h3>
<p>If you choose to use another IDE, you may need to install <a href="https://python.org/downloads">Python</a> first. As of this writing, <code>pygame</code> is not yet available for Python version 3.11, so choose Python 3.10.</p>
<p>After installing Python, run the following command in your terminal program (may require admininstrator privileges) to install the graphics and robotics software you will need for this course:</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="IO">pip3 install -U pip setuptools sc8pr</pre>
<p>On Windows, if the system does not recognize <code>pip3</code>, try typing the command as:</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="IO">py -3 -m pip install -U pip setuptools sc8pr</pre>

<h3>Assignment</h3><ol class="Assign">
<li>
<p>Test that your IDE is working properly by running the following Python 3 programs as examples. Here is an example of a simple console program (no graphics).</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's02_print.py'</span>

print(5 * 2)</pre>
<p>If you have “forked” the CS10 repl.it project, open the file <code>s02_print.py</code> and then paste the code into your program file. If you are using a different IDE or have not created your own fork, you will need to create this file first.</p>
<p>You can copy the entire code example by holding the <i>Alt</i> key and clicking anywhere in the code. If you are using a touch device, double-click to copy.</p>

<p>Here is an example that accepts input from the keyboard...</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's02_name.py'</span>

user = input("Please enter your name: ")
print("Hello, {}!".format(user))</pre>
</li>
</ol>
