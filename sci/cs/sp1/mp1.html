<p>For all questions, your programs must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>use appropriate comments and docstrings;</li>
    <li>use descriptive variable names;</li>
    <li>use “Input-Processing-Output” (IPO) program structure; </li>
    <li>be user-friendly. (Running the program should be easy, even for someone not already familiar with what the program does.)</li>
</ul><hr/>
<ol>
    <li>Create a Python program in your <code>CS10</code> repl using the file <code>sp1_turtle.py</code> that uses Python's “Turtle Graphics” to draw a “Figure 8”. Your program must accept user input in the <u>graphics window</u> to determine the size and colour of the Figure 8.</li>
    <li>Create a Python program in your <code>CS10</code> repl using the file <code>sp1_io.py</code>. This program should use <u>console</u> input and output to: (a) ask the user to enter a number, and (b) calculate the print the square (\(x^2\)) and cube (\(x^3\)) of the number.</li>
</ol>
