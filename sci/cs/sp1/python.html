<div class="Note">
<p>Python is a widely used programming language that is popular as a first language because it is easy to learn.<p>
<p>Use your IDE (i.e. repl.it) to create the following program in the file <code>s03_turtle.py</code>. (If you have
    created a fork of this course’s repl, the program should already be there. Otherwise, you can copy the example from this webpage and paste it into your Python file.)</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
from turtle import setup, speed, pencolor, penup, pendown, left, forward, backward, exitonclick

setup(600, 480)
speed(1)
pencolor("red")
penup()
backward(200)
left(45)
pendown()
forward(200)
exitonclick()</pre>

<p>Try to predict what the program will do. Run the program to see if you were right.
    (In repl.it, you need to open the configuration file <code>.replit</code> and indicate the file name
    you want on the <code>run</code> line.)</p>

<p>The program consists of a sequence of individual instructions that the computer will execute one
	at a time. Some programming languages use punctuation marks (often a semi-colon) to mark the end
	of each instruction. Python prefers to use as little punctuation as possible, so each Python
	instruction is typed on a separate line.</p>

<p>Most of the instructions in this program are function calls. A <b class="Red">function</b> is
	a named instruction that performs a specific task. In Python (and many other languages), you call
	a function by typing its name, followed by parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you type any
	additional information that the function needs to perform its task. The data that are passed to
	the function are called <b class="Red">arguments</b>...</p>
<pre class="Code">setup(600, 480)</pre>

<p>This instruction tells Python to run a function named <code>setup</code>, which sets the size of
	the graphics canvas. This function takes two arguments. The first argument (<code>600</code>) tells
	<code>setup</code> what we want the canvas width to be; the second argument (<code>480</code>)
	is the height.</p>

<p>When calling a function, the parentheses are required even if the function does not require any
	arguments. For example, the <code>penup()</code> and <code>pendown()</code> instructions.</p>

<p>This program is an example of “Turtle Graphics.” Imagine a turtle walking around the screen,
	drawing as it moves. We can think of this program as instructions that we are giving to the turtle.
	The <code>forward</code> and <code>backward</code> functions tell the turtle to move a certain distance
	in pixels. The <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> functions tell the turtle to turn by so many
	degrees. The <code>penup</code> and <code>pendown</code> and <code>pencolor</code> functions control
	the pen that the turtle is drawing with.</p>

<p>Python keeps the definitions for many of its functions in separate files called
	<b class="Red">modules</b>. Before your program can use a function, you need to tell Python
	to <code>import</code> (load) the function definition. The first line of the program above tells
	Python to import several functions located in the <code>turtle</code> module. If you try to
	call a function that you haven’t imported, an error will occur. (Try running the program after
	deleting the first line.)</p>
<pre class="Code">from turtle import setup, speed, pencolor, penup, pendown, left, forward, backward, exitonclick</pre>

<!--p>The asterix at the end of the <code>import</code> statement tells Python to import everything
	that it finds in the <code>turtle</code> module. Importing functions and data that your program
	doesn’t need wastes computer memory and processing power. If you only need to use a few of the
	features of a module, you should import only what you need...</p>
<pre class="Code">from turtle import forward, backward, left, right</pre-->

<p>There are a few functions that are so important or so common that Python loads them automatically; you do not need to import them. These functions are called <b class="Red">built-ins</b>. One built in function that we used in the last lesson is <code>print</code>.</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3><ol class="Assign">
<li>Create a new Python file called <code>s03_letter.py</code>. You can copy and paste the example program as a starting point.
    Modify the program so that it makes the turtle trace out the letter “Q” in your favourite colour.
	You can refer to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#overview-of-available-turtle-and-screen-methods"
	target="ref">documentation for the <code>turtle</code> module</a> to see what functions are
	available for controlling the turtle, in addition to the functions used in the example.</li>
