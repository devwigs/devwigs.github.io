<!--p>Eclipse may already be installed on computers in the Computing Science Lab. You will need to configure it the first time you use it.</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Workspace</b>: When Eclipse launches, you will be asked to choose a workspace. This is a
		folder where Eclipse will keep your files. Use the <span class="Code">CS10</span> folder in your
        EIPS OneDrive for your workspace location.  Use the same workspace every class.
		If you start Eclipse and your work seems to be missing, you have probably chosen the wrong
		workspace folder.</li>
	<li><b>Welcome</b>: When Eclipse has finished loading, you can close the Welcome tab.</li>
	<li><b>Perspective</b>: By default, Eclipse opens in the “Java” perspective. Java is a
		programming language that we will use in CS 30. For CS 10 and 20, most of our assignments
		will be done using the Python language. At the upper right of the Eclipse window, click the
		+ icon beside the Java button. Select “PyDev” (Python Development) from the list.

	</li>
	<li><b>Project</b>: To create a project, click the small triangle near the left end of the toolbar.
		Choose “PyDev Project” from the list.
		<p class="Center"><img class="Wide" alt="Image" src="img/newproject.png"/></p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Configure PyDev</b>: Enter <span class="Code">Python</span> for the project name.
		Change the “Grammar Version” to the highest available choice, and then click the link labelled
		“Please configure an interpreter before proceeding.” When asked how you want to proceed, choose
		“Manual Config”.

	</li>
	<li><b>Locate Python</b>: The list of available interpreters should be empty. Click the “New”
		button and type “Python 3.8” or “Python 3.7” for the interpreter name (whichever is installed). Click “Browse” and then locate the
		file <span class="Code">python.exe</span>. Click “OK” or “Finish” to close
		all of the dialog windows.
		<p class="Center"><img class="Wide" alt="Image" src="img/python37.png"/></p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Encoding</b>: Open Eclipse’s “Window” menu and choose “Preferences”. Under “General”, find
		“Workspace” and change the “Text File Encoding” to UTF-8.
		<p class="Center"><img class="Wide" alt="Image" src="img/utf8.png"/></p>
	</li>
	<li><b>New File</b>: Right-click on your project and choose “New | File”. Type a file name
		such as “test.py”. The file name must end in “.py” to be recognized as a Python file. Do
		not use spaces or punctuation marks in your file name.

	</li>
	<li><b>Write a Program</b>: In the editor, type a short program. You can copy and paste the examples below. Click the green and white “Run” button on the toolbar and select “Python Run”.</li>
