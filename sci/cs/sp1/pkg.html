<h3>Standard Library</h3><div class="Note"></div>
<p>The <code>print</code> and <code>input</code> functions are examples of Python “built-ins”.
	Built-ins are functions, classes, and other features that are part of the Python interpreter
	itself, or that the interpreter loads automatically. Built-in features are always available
	to your programs. Other built-ins that we have already seen include the <code>type</code>
	function and the classes <code>int</code>, <code>str</code>, and <code>float</code>.  Other
	useful built-ins that we have not seen yet include functions <code>round</code>, <code>min</code>,
	<code>max</code>, <code>sum</code>, and <code>len</code>. You can get a complete list of built-ins
	by running the following:</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's08_ex1.py'</span>

for b in sorted(vars(__builtins__)):
    print(b)</pre>

<p>Python does not load all available features automatically. If it did, programs would use far
	more memory than they need to and would take much longer to load. Instead, most available features
	are stored in separate files called <b class="Red">modules</b> that are only loaded when
	requested. We have used the <code>turtle</code> module in previous lessons to load turtle graphics
	functions. Use the <code>from-import</code> statement to import functions, classes, and data from
	a module. Import statements are usually placed at the beginning of the source code, right after the docstring.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment">"Program 's08_ex2.py'"</span>

from turtle import setup, forward, exitonclick

setup(500, 500)
forward(200)
exitonclick()</pre>

<p>It is also possible to use a “wildcard” to import <b>all</b> names of functions, classes, and data
	from a module...<p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code">from turtle import *</pre>

<p>It is generally better to avoid wildcard imports. Importing names that your program does not actually
	use requires more memory and makes Python run less efficiently. It also increases the likelihood of
	conflicts when the same name is used by more than one module.</p>

<p>The collection of modules that is included with the Python interpreter is called the
	<b class="Red">standard library</b>. In addition to <code>turtle</code> the standard library
	includes <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html" target="_m"><code>math</code></a>
	and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" target="_r"><code>random</code></a>,
	modules for performing mathematical and random number calculations.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's08_ex3.py'</span>

from math import pi, sqrt
from random import randint, uniform

print(pi)
print(sqrt(2))
print(randint(1,6))
print(uniform(1,6))</pre>
</div>

<h3>Site Packages</h3><div class="Note"></div>
<p>Sometimes, related modules are placed in a folder which is called a <b class="Red">package</b>.
	After installing Python and its standard library, you can add additional packages from other sources
	to add more functionality to Python. These are often called <b class="Red">site packages</b>.</p>

<p>The repl.it IDE can often recognize which packages your program uses and install them automatically.
    You can add or remove site packages by clicking “Packages” in the “Tools” panel.</p>
<p>When using Thonny to run Python programs locally, you can use “Manage packages...” under the “Tools” menu to choose the packages you want.</p>
<p>You can also use the Package Installer for Python (PIP) that is included with Python to install packages so that they can be used with all local IDEs.</p>
<p>For Computing Science 10, there are two site packages that we will need. <!--(The CS10 repl is already configured with these packages!)--></p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.pygame.org" target="_p"><code>pygame</code></a>: Provides supports for
		graphics, sound, and mouse and keyboard events; useful for creating games.</li>
	<li><a href="https://dmaccarthy.github.io/sc8pr" target="_8"><code>sc8pr</code></a>: Adds more
		features to <code>pygame</code> including a robotics simulator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other popular site packages include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.numpy.org" target="_n"><code>numpy</code></a> and <a href="https://scipy.org/scipylib/"
		target="_s"><code>scipy</code></a>: Used for scientific computing.</li>
	<li><a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_8"><code>pillow</code></a>: Use for encoding,
		decoding, and manipulation of image files.</li>
	<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/" target="_f"><code>flask</code></a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com//" target="_j"><code>django</code></a>:
		Simplify the process of creating web applications in Python.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Python Software Foundation maintains an extensive <a href="https://pypi.org/" target="_pypi">index
	of available packages</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how to import from a package. As long as the site package (<code>numpy</code>) has been properly installed,
    there is no difference between importing from the standard library and from the site package. If <code>numpy</code> is not installed, the program will raise an <code>ModuleNotFoundError</code>.
    (To see this, try misspelling <code>numpy</code> as <code>nupy</code>.)</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's08_ex4.py'</span>

from numpy import zeros

z = zeros((3, 2))
print(z)</pre>

<h3>Assignment</h3><ol class="Assign">
<li>Write a program <code>s08_sphere.py</code> that prompts the user to enter the radius of a sphere and then calculates the volume and surface area of the sphere using the formulas:
    $$V = {4 \over 3}\pi r^3$$ $$A = 4\pi r^2$$
    Use the value of \(\pi\) imported from the <code>math</code> module.</li>

<li>You may have learned about the Pythagoras equation in Math class:$$c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$
    This equation lets us calculate the longest side of a right triangle, <code>c</code>, if we know the other two sides, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
    Write a program <code>s08_pythag.py</code> that prompts the user to enter <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and then calculates <code>c</code> using the <code>sqrt</code> function from the <code>math</code> module.</li>

<li>The program below is supposed to simulate rolling a pair of dice. Currently, the program
    always rolls a 6 and a 3. Modify the program to randomize the roll using the <code>randint</code>
    function from the <code>random</code> module.
