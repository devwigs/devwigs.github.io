<h3>Sets</h3><div class="Note">
<p>All of the iterable data types that we have looked at so far — strings, tuples, lists, and range objects — represent <em>ordered</em> sequences.
    Python includes a <code>set</code> class that can be used for <em>unordered</em> collections of objects.</p>
<p>Suppose we wanted to create a data structure to represent the four suits in a deck of cards. Although we <em>could</em> use a tuple or list, the order of the suits usually doesn’t matter.  For such a circumstance, we might choose to use a <code>set</code> rather than a <code>tuple</code>...</p>
<pre data-mime="text" class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
<span class="Comment"># Example 1...</span>

suits = {"Hearts", "Spades", "Diamonds", "Clubs"}
for suit in suits:
    print(suit)
print(type(suits))</pre>

<p>Recall that square brackets signify a <code>list</code> in Python, no brackets or <em>parentheses</em> (round brackets)
    signify a <code>tuple</code>. As the example above illustrates, curly brackets (braces) signify a <code>set</code>.</p>
<p>Because the order of the items in a <code>set</code> is not significant, the <code>for-in</code> loop in the example might
    print the suits in a different order than they were listed when the <code>set</code> was created. Since the items in a
    <code>set</code> have no specific order, you cannot use indices or slices. Like lists, sets are <em>mutable</em>; you can
    modify the contents of a <code>set</code> with the <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> methods...</p>
<pre data-mime="text" class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
<span class="Comment"># Example 2...</span>

suits = {"Hearts", "Spades", "Diamonds", "Unicorns"}
suits.add("Clubs")
suits.remove("Unicorns")
print(suits)</pre>

<p>Python includes an immutable version of a set that is named <code class="Red">frozenset</code>...</p>
<pre data-mime="text" class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
<span class="Comment"># Example 3...</span>

suits = frozenset({"Hearts", "Spades", "Diamonds", "Unicorns"})
suits.remove("Unicorns")      <span class="Comment"># AttributeError</span></pre>

<p>A special property of the <code>set</code> and <code>frozenset</code> classes is that they cannot contain duplicate items.
    In the program below, the duplicates (<code>"Hearts"</code> and <code>"Spades"</code>) will only be included in the <code>set</code> once...</p>
<pre data-mime="text" class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
<span class="Comment"># Example 4...</span>

suits = {"Hearts", "Spades", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Clubs", "Spades"}
print(suits)</pre>

<p>This property makes sets useful for removing duplicates from a list or tuple...</p>
<pre data-mime="text" class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
<span class="Comment"># Example 5...</span>

data = [1, 4, 0, 7, 4, 5, 1, 12]
dataAsSet = frozenset(data)
data = sorted(dataAsSet)
print(data)                     <span class="Comment"># [0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 12]</span></pre>

<h3>Dictionaries</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Suppose you wanted to create an object to represent personal data for one of your friends (name, email, birthday, phone
    number). You might use a <code>set</code> because the order in which the items are stored is not important...</p>
<pre data-mime="text" class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
myFriend = {"Jane Doe", "jdoe@salcomp.ca", "1995-11-02",
    "780-555-5555"}</pre>
<p>Unfortunately there is no way to extract a specific item from a <code>set</code>; if you want to print the email address
    for example, the Python interpreter has no way of knowing which of the four items that is.</p>
<p>When you have an unordered collection of items from which you need to be able to reference a specific item, you can use a
    <b class="Red">dictionary</b> (abbreviated <code>dict</code>).  A dictionary is like a <code>set</code> for which each item
    has a descriptive <b class="Red">key</b> that can be used to identify it...</p>
<pre data-mime="text" class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
<span class="Comment"># Example 6...</span>

myFriend = {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jdoe@salcomp.ca",
    "birthday": "1999-11-02",
    "phone": "780-555-5555"
}

print(myFriend["email"])   <span class="Comment"># jdoe@salcomp.ca</span></pre>

<p>You can add additional items to an existing dictionary by assigning them with a new key, and you can delete items
    with the <code>del</code> operator...</p>
<pre data-mime="text" class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
<span class="Comment"># Example 7...</span>

myFriend = {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jdoe@salcomp.ca",
    "birthday": "1995-11-02",
    "phone": "780-555-5555"
    }
myFriend["hobbies"] = "Soccer", "Running", "Computer Programming"
del myFriend["email"]
print(myFriend)</pre>

<p>Note that dictionaries use a similar syntax to lists and tuples when referring to a single item, with a key used in place
    of an index: <code>myFriend["hobbies"]</code>.  String objects are often used as keys since strings can describe what
    information the item contains. However, the Python interpreter allows you to use any immutable object as a key,
    including <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>bool</code> and <code>tuple</code> instances. (In the case of tuples,
    all of the items in the <code>tuple</code> must also be immutable).</p>
</div>

<h3>Dictionaries & Iteration</h3><div class="Note">
<p>When you use a <code>for-in</code> loop with a <code>dict</code> instance as the iterable, the loop iterates through the
    keys, not the item values. The <code>dict</code> class has a <code>values</code> method that you can use if you want to
    iterate through the item values rather than the keys, and a <code>items</code> method to iterate through (key, value)
    pairs as <code>tuples</code>. Run the following program to see how the different ways of iterating through a dictionary
    work...</p>
<pre data-mime="text" class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
<span class="Comment"># Example 8...</span>

myFriend = {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jdoe@salcomp.ca",
    "birthday": "1995-11-02",
    "phone": "780-555-5555"
    }

print("Keys...")
for x in myFriend:
    print(x)

print("\nValues...")
for x in myFriend.values():
    print(x)

print("\n(Key,Value) Tuples...")
for x in myFriend.items():
    print(x)</pre>

<p>The <code>in</code> operator (without <code>for</code>) works in the same way...</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3><ol class="Assign">
<li>
    <p>Here are the North Division standings for 2021 taken from the <a target="NHL" href="https://www.nhl.com/standings/2020/division">National Hockey League website</a>.</p>
    <p class="Center"><img src="ds/img/nhl.png" alt="NHL"/></p>
    <p>Complete the program <code>d03_north.py</code> to encode the data as a Python 3 dictionary of dictionaries.
        Use the city names ("Edmonton") as keys for the main dictionary, <code>north</code>, and use the column heading
        ("Wins") as keys for each team’s data. Do not encode the "GP", "PTS", and "P%" data as these can be calculated from
        other data.</p>
</li>

<li><p>A playing card can be represented by a dictionary with the keys suit and value. The suit is one of the strings <code>"Hearts"</code>,
    <code>"Spades"</code>, <code>"Diamonds"</code>, or <code>"Clubs"</code> and the value is a number between 1 (Ace) and 13 (King). A deck of cards can be
    represented by a <code>list</code> of the 52 different cards.</p>
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
        <li>In the program <code>d03_cards.py</code>, complete the function <code>makeDeck</code> to create a card deck as described above.
    <li>Also complete the function <code>deal</code> to deal the cards. Calling <code>deal(deck, 5, 2)</code> should create
        and return a <code>list</code> of 2 hands containing 5 cards each and should remove those ten cards from the deck.</li>
    <li>Finally, complete the function <code>prettyFormat</code> to display a card in a user-friendly format. For example,
        rather than printing <code>{"suit": "Hearts", "value": 12}</code>, we would like the card to be displayed as <code>"Queen of Hearts"</code>.</li>
