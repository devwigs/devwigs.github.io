<h3>List Comprehensions</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Python includes a feature for making lists by performing the same operation on a sequence of objects. Suppose that we have a sequence of ordered pairs representing points on a drawing (e.g. the alien spacecraft locations in a space invaders type game).  We need to calculate the distance between each point and some other point (e.g. the player’s ship).  We might write the following...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
<span class="Comment"># Example 1...</span>

from math import hypot

def distance(p1, p2):
    <span class="Comment">"""Calculate the distance between two points,
    rounded to the nearest whole number"""</span>
    x = p1[0] - p2[0]
    y = p1[1] - p2[1]
    return round(hypot(x, y))

def main():
    invaders = (5, 100), (30, 150), (55, 200), (80, 150), (105, 200)
    player = (300, 620)
    distanceList = []
    for ship in invaders:
        distanceList.append(distance(ship, player))
    print(distanceList)      <span class="Comment"># [598, 542, 486, 519, 463]</span>

main()</pre>

<p>In the <code>main</code> procedure above, we created an empty list, <code>distanceList</code>, and then used a <code>for</code> loop to iterate through the sequence of invader ships, appending each result to the list.
    Below is an abbreviated version of the procedure that uses a list comprehension (shown in blue)...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
<span class="Comment"># Example 2...</span>

def main():
    invaders = (5,100), (30, 150), (55, 200), (80, 150), (105, 200)
    player = (300, 620)
    distanceList = <span class="Blue">[distance(ship, player) for ship in invaders]</span>
    print(distanceList)      <span class="Comment"># [598, 542, 486, 519, 463]</span></pre>

<p>The list comprehension shortens the <code>for</code> loop into a single statement, while automatically assembling the results into a list. We do not need to initialize the list or append items explicitly.  The syntax for a list comprehension is...</p>
<pre class="IO">[&lt;Expression&gt; for &lt;Item&gt; in &lt;Sequence&gt;]</pre>
<p>...where <code>&lt;Sequence&gt;</code> is any <code>list</code>, <code>tuple</code>, string, or other iterable object;
    <code>&lt;Item&gt;</code> is the local variable name you want to use for the items in the sequence;
    and <code>&lt;Expression&gt;</code> is the expression to be evaluated and appended to the <code>list</code> for each item.</p>
</div>

<h3>Conditional Comprehensions</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Suppose in the previous example, we wanted to obtain a <code>list</code> of invaders that were within
    a certain distance of the player’s ship. We could do this with a <em>conditional</em> list comprehension.</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
<span class="Comment"># Example 3...</span>

def main():
    invaders = (5,100), (30, 150), (55, 200), (80, 150), (105, 200)
    player = (300, 620)
    nearby = [ship for ship in invaders <span class="Blue">if distance(ship, player) < 500</span>]
    print(nearby)      <span class="Comment"># [(55, 200), (105, 200)]</span></pre>

<p>The <code>if</code> condition at the end of the comprehension specifies which items are to be included in the <code>list</code>.
    In this example, the sequence (<code>invaders</code>) contains five items, but only two of those items
    satisfy the condition <code>distance(ship, player) < 500</code>. The result of this comprehension will be a <code>list</code>
    containing the two invader ships that are within 500 pixels of the player’s ship.</p>
<p>The general syntax for a conditional list comprehension is...</p>
<pre class="IO">[&lt;Expression&gt; for &lt;Item&gt; in &lt;Sequence&gt; if &lt;Condition&gt;]</pre>
</div>

<h3>Nested Comprehensions</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Python also supports nested <code>for...in</code> clauses within list comprehensions...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-mime="text/plain">
<span class="Comment"># Example 4...</span>

suits = "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades"
values = list(range(2, 11)) + ["Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"]
deck = [(suit, val) <span class="Blue">for suit in suits for val in values</span>]
for card in deck: print(card)</pre>
</div>

<h3>Assignment</h3><ol class="Assign">
<li>Suppose we want to apply a formula or calculation to many different data points. For example, we might start with a list of numbers and want to calculate the square root of each number and collect the results in a list. The data might be [1.0, 25.0, 6.25, 16.0], and the results would be [1.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0]. Complete the program <code>d05_sqrt.py</code> to perform this calculation using a list comprehension.</li>
<li>Complete the program <code>d05_noVowel.py</code> to use a list comprehension to remove all of the vowels* from a string.  (*Assume ‘y’ is not a vowel.) The input "Toronto Blue Jays!" should produce output "Trnt Bl Jys!".</li>
<li>Complete the program <code>d05_numsOnly.py</code> to use a list comprehension to collect a <code>list</code> of numbers (data that has either <code>int</code> or <code>float</code> as its type) from a <code>list</code> that may contain other types of data.</li>
