<h3>Dice Simulation</h3>

<p>When we roll a pair of dice, the chances of rolling a 7 are six times greater than rolling a 2 or 12, because there is only one way to roll a 2 (1 + 1) or 12 (6 + 6) but there are six different ways to roll a 7 (1 + 6, 2 + 5, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 5 + 2, and 6 + 1).</p>
<p>Using procedural programming techniques (such as top-down design) write a program that simulates rolling a pair of dice many times and keeps track of how many times each result (2 through 12) occurs. Let the user running the program enter how many rolls to simulate up to a maximum of 500.</p>
<p>When the simulation is complete, print out the results in the form of a graph like the following:</p>

<pre class="IO"> 2 *******
 3 *****************
 4 *************************
 5 ********************************
 6 *****************************************
 7 ************************************************
 8 ***************************************
 9 ********************************
10 ************************
11 *****************
12 *********</pre>

<p>or as a data table like the following, at the users request:</p>
<pre class="IO"> 2   7
 3  17
 4  25
 5  32
 6  41
 7  48
 8  39
 9  32
10  24
11  17
12   9</pre>

<p>Also compare the number of 7's to the number of 2's and 12's to verify that the chances of rolling a 7 are six times greater than rolling a 2 or 12 as we predicted.</p>
<p>Create a Python program that solves the propblem posed above. Write the program in your <code>CS20</code> repl using the file name <code>dp1_dice.py</code> and ensure your program does the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>use appropriate comments and docstrings;</li>
    <li>use descriptive variable names;</li>
    <li>handle all exceptions that are likely to occur;</li>
    <li>use a separate function for each task; </li>
    <li>be user-friendly. (Running the program should be easy, even for someone not already familiar with what the program does.)</li>
</ul>
