<h3>Exponential Function</h3>
<div class="Note">
<p>There is a very important function in mathematics called the <em>exponential</em> function that can be defined by an <em>infinite</em> series:
    $$\exp(x) = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} +...$$</p>
<p>Note that each term in the series can be obtained by multiplying the previous term by \(x/n\) where \(n\) is the number of previous terms and \(x\) is the argument of the function. For example, the next (fifth) term in the series is:
    $$\frac{x^3}{6}\cdot \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x^4}{24}$$</p>
<p>The next term after that is:
    $$\frac{x^4}{24}\cdot \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x^5}{120}$$</p>
<p>In an earlier lesson, you saw a simplified version of this series that did not contain the parameter \(x\).</p>
<p>Python has a function called <code>exp</code> (which can be imported from the <code>math</code> module) that totals the terms in the series.</p>

<p>Create a Python file <code>dp2_exp.py</code> and copy the following program into it.</p>

def exp_terms(x, n=100):
    yield 0


<span class="Comment"># Do NOT modify any of the code below!!</span>

from math import exp

def test_exp():
    print((3*"{:^10s}").format("x", "exp", "Series"))
    for i in range(51):
        x = i / 10
        e1 = exp(x)
        e2 = sum(exp_terms(x))
        print(f"{x:10.4f}{e1:10.4f}{e2:10.4f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_exp()</pre>
<p>Complete the function <code>exp_terms</code> as a <b class="Red">generator</b> to yield each of the terms in the series
    as described above. While it is impossible to total an infinite series (it would take an infinite amount of time),
    generating a large number of terms (e.g. 100) should give a reasonable approximation.</p>
<p>The test program prints out a table comparing Python’s <code>exp</code> function to the sum of your series.
    When your function is working properly, the results should all agree.</p>

<h3>Trigonometry Functions</h3>
<div class="Note">
<p>It turns out that this series is closely related to the important trigonometry functions <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code>.
    To calculate these trig functions, we need to extract the even-index terms (<code>cos</code>) or the odd-index terms (<code>sin</code>),
    and then we need to alternate the signs of the terms.</p>
<ol start="2"><li>
<p>Create a Python file <code>dp2_trig.py</code> and copy the following program.
    Complete the function <code>exp_alt</code> using one or more <b class="Red">list comprehensions</b>.</p>

from dp2_exp import exp_terms

def exp_alt(x, even, n=100):
    terms = list(exp_terms(x, n))
    
    <span class="Comment"># Complete this function using one or more list comprehensions!</span>

    return terms

from math import sin, cos, pi

def test_trig():
    print((5*"{:^10s}").format("x", "sin", "Series", "cos", "Series"))
    x = list(range(51)) + [10 * pi, 5 * pi, 2.5 * pi]
    for i in sorted(x):
        x = i / 10
        s1 = sin(x)
        s2 = sum(exp_alt(x, False))
        c1 = cos(x)
        c2 = sum(exp_alt(x, True))
        print(f"{x:10.4f}{s1:10.4f}{s2:10.4f}{c1:10.4f}{c2:10.4f}")

test_trig()</pre>
<p>Starting with the list of terms generated by your <code>exp_terms</code> function from question 1, your function needs to <em>alternate</em> the terms based on the parameter <code>even</code>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If <code>even</code> is <code>True</code>, you need to create a new list with only even-index terms from the original list, and alternate the signs of those even terms; term 0 should be \(+\), term 2 should be \(-\), term 4 should be \(+\), etc.</li>
    <li>If <code>even</code> is <code>False</code>, you need to create a new list with only odd-index terms from the original list, and alternate the signs of those odd terms; term 1 should be \(+\), term 3 should be \(-\), term 5 should be \(+\), etc.</li>
    <li>All terms in the original list are positive.</li>
</ul>
<p>The test program prints out a table comparing Python’s <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code> functions to the sum of your series.
    When your function is working properly, the results should all agree.</p>
