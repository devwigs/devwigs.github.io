<article><h1>The <code>setup</code> Function</h1>

<p>The example program on the previous page created a sketch that displayed a white background. If you want to change the background or add more content to the sketch, you need to create a <code>setup</code> function. This function takes a single argument <code>sk</code>, which refers to the sketch itself. Don’t confuse the <em>variable</em> <code>sk</code> with <code>Sketch</code> (the <em>function</em> that creates the sketch in the first place!)</p>

<p>In this example, the <code>setup</code> function changes the sketch’s background color to blue. Make sure you define the <code>setup</code> function <em>before</em> your program plays the sketch.</p>

<pre class="Code" id="Ex1">from sc8pr import Sketch

def setup(sk):
    sk.bg = "blue"

Sketch().play()</pre>

<p>Colors can be described by any color name that <code>pygame</code> recognizes, or by an RGB tuple or hexadecimal string.  The following statements are alternative ways of setting the background to blue...</p>

<pre class="Code" id="Ex2">sk.bg = 0, 0, 255
sk.bg = "#0000ff"</pre>

<p>Your sketch background does not have to be a single color; you can use an image as your background instead. The example below loads an image from the file “sky.png” and sets it as the sketch background. If the image file is in a different folder than your program, you must include the full path. If the image aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of the sketch, <code>sc8pr</code> may resize the sketch to fit the background or stretch the background to fit the sketch, depending on whether the sketch’s <code>fixedAspect</code> has been set to <code>True</code> (the default) or <code>False</code>.  <!-- See the page on <a href="">managing the aspect ratio</a> for more information. --></p>

<pre class="Code" id="Ex3">from sc8pr import Sketch, Image

def setup(sk):
    sk.fixedAspect = False    <span class="Comment"># Allow background to stretch</span>
    sk.bg = Image("sky.png")

Sketch().play()</pre>

<p>For <code>sc8pr</code> to be able to locate your setup function on its own, your function must be named <code>setup</code> and it must be located in the same file as your main program. If you want to use a setup function with a different name or location, you will need to help <code>sc8pr</code> find it...</p>

<pre class="Code" id="Ex4">Sketch().<span class="Hilite">bind(setup=mySetupFunction)</span>.play()</pre>

<p>Before playing your sketch, call its <code>bind</code> method to tell <code>sc8pr</code> what you want to use as your setup function. In the example above, a function called <code>mySetupFunction</code> will be used.</p>
